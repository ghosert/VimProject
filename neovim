# Lesson 2.3: ON OPERATORS AND MOTIONS

Many commands that change text are made from an operator and a motion.
The format for a delete command with the [d](d) delete operator is as follows:

    d   motion

  Where:
    d      - is the delete operator.
    motion - is what the operator will operate on (listed below).

  A short list of motions:
    w - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character.
    e - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character.
    $ - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character.

  Thus typing 'de' will delete from the cursor to the end of the word.

NOTE:  Pressing just the motion while in Normal mode without an operator
       will move the cursor as specified.

# Lesson 2.4: USING A COUNT FOR A MOTION

** Typing a number before a motion repeats it that many times. **

 1. Move the cursor to the start of the line marked ✓ below.

 2. Type 2w to move the cursor two words forward.

 3. Type 3e to move the cursor to the end of the third word forward.

 4. Type 0 (zero) to move to the start of the line.

 5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with different numbers.

# Lesson 2.5: USING A COUNT TO DELETE MORE

** Typing a number with an operator repeats it that many times. **

In the combination of the delete operator and a motion mentioned above you
insert a count before the motion to delete more:
     d   number   motion

 1. Move the cursor to the first UPPER CASE word in the line marked ✗.

 2. Type d2w to delete the two UPPER CASE words

 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different count to delete the consecutive
    UPPER CASE words with one command

# Lesson 2.7: THE UNDO COMMAND

** Press u to undo the last commands, `U`{normal} to fix a whole line. **

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked ✗ and place it on the first error.

 2. Type x to delete the first unwanted character.

 3. Now type u to undo the last command executed.

 4. This time fix all the errors on the line using the x command.

 5. Now type a capital U to return the line to its original state.

 6. Now type u a few times to undo the U and preceding commands.

 7. Now type C-r (Control + R) a few times to redo the commands.

Fiix the errors oon thhis line and reeplace them witth undo.

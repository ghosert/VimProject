## eBay Electronics Business Strategy
**Context:** Seller ships physical electronics (phones/tablets) from China to the USA.
**Current Metrics:** $1,000/month profit from selling ~10 units (High margin: ~$100 profit/unit).

### 1-Year Earnings Projection
*   **Scenario A: Organic Growth (Reinvesting Profits)**
    *   *Constraint:* Cash flow ties up inventory purchase power.
    *   *Strategy:* Adding 1 reliable model every 2 months.
    *   *Estimate:* **$4,000 – $6,000 per month.**
*   **Scenario B: Aggressive Growth (External Capital)**
    *   *Constraint:* Quality control and sourcing speed.
    *   *Strategy:* Aggressively testing 3-4 new models/month.
    *   *Estimate:* **$10,000 – $12,000 per month.**

### Industry Benchmarks (Successful Independent Sellers)
*   **Full-Time Solo:** $4k – $8k/mo (Net Profit).
*   **Power Seller (Small Team):** $10k – $25k/mo (Net Profit). Note: Usually relies on lower margins but higher volume.

### Critical Risks for Cross-Border Electronics
1.  **Cash Flow:** Hardware ties up significantly more capital than digital goods.
2.  **Returns:** Shipping a return from USA to China is often cost-prohibitive, leading to total loss on defective units.
3.  **Depreciation:** Tech loses value weekly; inventory cannot sit stagnant.

### Strategic Advice
Maintain your **$100/unit margin**. Do not chase high revenue numbers ("Vanity Metrics") by competing in low-margin categories (e.g., $10 profit/unit). Selling 5 high-margin phones a day puts you in the top tier of earners with less logistical headache.

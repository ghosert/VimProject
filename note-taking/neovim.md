## Tips for Marksman

Marksman plugin[reference]:

1. `:Vspt` will open terminal inside neovim vertically.
2. `:Spt` will open terminal inside neovim horizontally.
3. `:vsp newfile` will open newfile inside neovim vertically.
4. `:sp newfile` will open newfile inside neovim horizontally.

## Tips for Tab, WD and Dashboard

1. `:tabnew newfile` to open a file in a new tab.
2. gt -> next tab, gT -> previous tab, 2gt -> next 2 tab
3. `<leader>.` to set file location as current working directory

## Tips for AI Plugins

1. Run with `aider --vim --code-theme monokai` and then type `/help question` on how to use aider, type `/ask question` on chat mode
2. aider can be started by `viai` and `viail` in a neovim terminal(easy to share clipboard across neovim) in separate tmux window(easy to resize window), `viai` and `viail` are both defined inside ~/docker/.zshrc
3. avante.nvim is for single file AI modification, customized shortcuts inside ~/.config/nvim/lua/avante/config.lua

## Lesson 2.3: ON OPERATORS AND MOTIONS

Many commands that change text are made from an operator and a motion.
The format for a delete command with the [d](d) delete operator is as follows:

    d   motion

  Where:
    d      - is the delete operator.
    motion - is what the operator will operate on (listed below).

  A short list of motions:
    w - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character.
    e - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character.
    $ - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character.

  Thus typing 'de' will delete from the cursor to the end of the word.

NOTE:  Pressing just the motion while in Normal mode without an operator
       will move the cursor as specified.

## Lesson 2.4: USING A COUNT FOR A MOTION

** Typing a number before a motion repeats it that many times. **

 1. Move the cursor to the start of the line marked ✓ below.

 2. Type 2w to move the cursor two words forward.

 3. Type 3e to move the cursor to the end of the third word forward.

 4. Type 0 (zero) to move to the start of the line.

 5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with different numbers.

## Lesson 2.5: USING A COUNT TO DELETE MORE

** Typing a number with an operator repeats it that many times. **

In the combination of the delete operator and a motion mentioned above you
insert a count before the motion to delete more:
     d   number   motion

 1. Move the cursor to the first UPPER CASE word in the line marked ✗.

 2. Type d2w to delete the two UPPER CASE words

 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different count to delete the consecutive
    UPPER CASE words with one command

## Lesson 2.7: THE UNDO COMMAND

** Press u to undo the last commands, `U`{normal} to fix a whole line. **

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked ✗ and place it on the first error.

 2. Type x to delete the first unwanted character.

 3. Now type u to undo the last command executed.

 4. This time fix all the errors on the line using the x command.

 5. Now type a capital U to return the line to its original state.

 6. Now type u a few times to undo the U and preceding commands.

 7. Now type C-r (Control + R) a few times to redo the commands.

Fiix the errors oon thhis line and reeplace them witth undo.

## Lesson 3 SUMMARY

 1. To put back text that has just been deleted, type [p](p). This puts the
    deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the
    line below the cursor).

 2. To replace the character under the cursor, type [r](r) and then the
    character you want to have there.

 3. The [change operator](c) allows you to change from the cursor to where
    the motion takes you. Type `ce`{normal} to change from the cursor to the
    end of the word, `c$`{normal} to change to the end of a line, etc.

 4. The format for change is:

        c   [number]   motion



## Lesson 5.3: SELECTING TEXT TO WRITE

** To save part of the file, type `v` motion `:w FILENAME`. **

 1. Move the cursor to this line.

 2. Press v and move the cursor to the fifth item below. Notice that the
    text is highlighted.

 3. Press the `:` character. At the bottom of the screen

        `:'<,'>`

    will appear.

 4. Type

        `:w TEST`

    where TEST is a filename that does not exist yet. Verify that you see

        `:'<,'>w TEST`

    before you press `<Enter>`.

 5. Neovim will write the selected lines to the file TEST. Use `:!ls` to see it.
    Do not remove it yet! We will use it in the next lesson.

NOTE: Pressing v starts [Visual selection](visual-mode). You can move the cursor around to
      make the selection bigger or smaller. Then you can use an operator to
      do something with the text. For example, `d` deletes the text.

## Lesson 5.4: RETRIEVING AND MERGING FILES

** To retrieve the contents of a file, type `:r FILENAME`. **

 1. Place the cursor just above this line.

NOTE:  After executing Step 2 you will see text from Lesson 5.3. Then move
       DOWN to see this lesson again.

 2. Now retrieve your TEST file using the command

        `:r TEST`

    where TEST is the name of the file you used.
    The file you retrieve is placed below the cursor line.

 3. To verify that a file was retrieved, cursor back and notice that there
    are now two copies of Lesson 5.3, the original and the retrieved version.

NOTE: You can also read the output of an external command. For example,

        `:r !ls`

      reads the output of the `ls` command and puts it below the cursor.


## Lesson 7.1: GETTING HELP

** Use the online help system. **

Neovim has a comprehensive online help system.

To get started, try one of these three:

  - press the `<F1>` key (if you have one)
  - type `:help`

Read the text in the help window to find out how the help works.
Type `<C-w><C-w>` to jump from one window to another.
Type `:q` to close the help window.


## Lesson 7.3: COMPLETION

** Command line completion with `<C-d>`{normal} and `<Tab>`{normal}. **

 1. List the contents of the current directory: `:!ls`{vim}

 2. Type the start of a command: `:e`{vim}

 3. Press `<C-d>`{normal} and Neovim will show a list of commands beginning with "e".

 4. Press `<Tab>`{normal} and Neovim will complete the command name to ":edit".

 5. Now add a space and the start of an existing file name: `:edit FIL`{vim}

 6. Press `<Tab>`{normal}. Neovim will complete the name ("FIL" -> "FILE", if it is unique).

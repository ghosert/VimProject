## Fix Plan for Zybuluo

```
Problem: For MySql 8.0.36, SQLAlchemy 0.7.9 need to be updated like below:

$ vi ~/devenv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/SQLAlchemy-0.7.9-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/sqlalchemy/dialects/mysql/base.py

Search @@tx_isolation, replace it with @@transaction_isolation

def get_isolation_level(self, connection):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    # jiawzhang update this for mysql 8
    # cursor.execute('SELECT @@tx_isolation')
    cursor.execute('SELECT @@transaction_isolation')
    val = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    cursor.close()
return val.upper().replace("-", " ")
```

I read this book <Dive Into Python> 6 chapters and stop reading it.

Because some guys on the internet the book is not good for beginner.

I agree it after reading 6 chapters. So I stop reading.

I begin to read standard python <Tutorial> and when I feel good I will continue to read the rest part of <Dive Into Python>.

When you feel you can't get more from twill script in python:

for example:
The clause "twill.commands.find('regular expression')" will not return result in python.
(Although this case you can Use "html=twill.commands.show()  html.find('regular expression')")

But somebody online said:

Why use Twill if you are within python?? Why not use the mechanize/
ClientForm modules? ... From what I know Twill is just a wrapper around 
these anyway. There are good usage examples on their website :

http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/

So, in the testtwill.py file, is there any way to invoke mechanize from twill module?

The content is practised in ~/VimProject/StudyPyramid/MyProject, the original url is: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/tutorials/wiki2/index.html

You can search "grep jiawzhang * -r" in ~/VimProject/StudyPyramid/MyProject/myproject to see the changes.

Prerequisite(Do this once, optionally):
1. Check out ~/Dropbox/ubuntu_install_guide.sh to install virtualenv and pyramid.
2. cd ~/VimProject/StudyPyramid/MyProject
   source ~/devenv/bin/activate
   python setup.py develop
The two steps above will make sure all the python libs you need is preinstalled. If you modified ../MyProject/setup.py and add new libs, run 'python setup.py develop' once again, so that new libs will be installed.

Try on the live site for tutorial when developing:
1. source ~/devenv/bin/activate
2. cd ~/VimProject/StudyPyramid/MyProject
3. python setup.py develop(optional: if your virtualenv is not up to date, run this)
4. pserve development.ini --reload
5. visit http://localhost:6543/
6. Edit the page to add some words like "\b([A-Z]\w+[A-Z]+\w+)", for example: "SomePage".
7. Input "viewer"/"viewer" or "editor"/"editor" as username/password if it ask login. "editor" is granted "edit" permission.
8. "python setup.py test -q" OR "nosetests" OR "nosetests --cover-package=myproject --cover-erase --with-coverage" to run test case in ~/xxx/MyProject folder.
9. Distributing your application: "python setup.py sdist" this will generate a tarball which can be installed by pointing the "easy_install" command directly at it.

10. log file is defined in development.ini and it's located in /var/log/pyramid/server.log

Try on the live site for tutorial on PRODUCTION:
0. You may need to run the command lines below to make sure all the libs in virtualenv is up to date.
   cd ~/VimProject/StudyPyramid/MyProject
   source ~/devenv/bin/activate
   python setup.py develop
1. sudo nginx
   To work nginx together with uwsgi. Check out "/usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf" or "~/ProductProject/env-conf/nginx.conf"
2. uwsgi --ini-paste-logged ~/VimProject/StudyPyramid/MyProject/production.ini
   To work pyramid app together with uwsgi. Check out "[uwsgi]" section in "development.ini" and "production.ini" to see details.
3. visit http://localhost/python
   This support the "Virtual Hosting"(search below) "/python" feature.
4. reload and stop an daemon uwsgi, "kill -9 pid" or uwsgi --reload/--stop /var/log/pyramid/pid_5000.pid
5. To stop nginx:  $ sudo kill -QUIT `cat /usr/local/nginx/logs/nginx.pid`

6. log file is defined in production.ini and it's located in /var/log/pyramid/server.log and /var/log/pyramid/uwsgi.log

http://docs.pylonsproject.org/docs/pyramid.html

Including: Getting Started, Main Documentation (like Narrative documentation), Pyramid Add-On Documentation (like pyramid_beaker for Beaker session, pyramid_rpc for remote procedure call)

[END: Pyramid Documentation]




[BEGIN: Narrative documentation]

This document is mainly from official site of pyramid: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/, check it out if you can find answer below.

First Pyramid Application:
1. start it:
	~/devenv/bin/python helloworld.py
	OR
	source ~/devenv/bin/activate && python helloworld.py
2. visit it:
	http://localhost:8080/
	http://localhost:8080/goodbye/
	http://localhost:8080/hello/
	http://localhost:8080/test_route/name

Creating a Pyramid Project:

# Before you do anything else, activate virtual python env first:
	source ~/devenv/bin/activate

# Create new project
	'pcreate -s starter MyProject' (URL dispatch without persistence mechanism)
	Or
	'pcreate -s alchemy MyProject' (URL dispatch with persistence via SQLAlchemy)

# Make sure from now on your working directory is your project folder: MyProject
	cd MyProject

# Install new project for development, this will install a distribution into the python interpreter's library set, such as pserve, pshell, proutes and pviews.
	python setup.py develop

# Run test case, the tests are in MyProject/myproject/tests.py
	python setup.py test -q

# Exposing Test Coverage Information

	$ ../bin/nosetests OR ../bin/nosetests --cover-package=myproject --cover-erase --with-coverage

	This will do the same thing as "python setup.py test -q" but with additional "coverage" information.

# Initializing the Database

	$ ../bin/initialize_MyProject_db development.ini

	This will execute the file located in MyProject/myproject/script/initializedb.py

# Interactive shell, "MyProject" here is the value of section name "app" in development.ini file, see more about pshell in pyramid docs.
	pshell development.ini MyProject

# Running the project application
	pserve development.ini
	OR for development phase:
	pserve development.ini --reload
	OR for production phase:
	pserve production.ini

# tar your application:
	python setup.py sdist
	This will tar a .tar.gz file for your application, and make sure all the non-python file types are in your MANIFEST.in file, otherwise, the tar will miss these unspecified file types.

# Modifying Package Structure:
	You can create a new package for example "views" under "myproject" folder and "mv views.py views/blog.py", and create "myproject/views/__init__.py"

# myproject/__init__.py:main function:
	def main(global_config, **settings=settings):
		config = Configurator(settings = settings)
		// blablabla
	if you have a "[DEFAULT]" section in development.ini, "global_config" here stores all the key/values pairs in "[DEFAULT]" section.
	"settings" here stores all the key/values pairs in "[app:main]" section in development except one: "use = egg:MyProject"
	 you can put anything you want here into "settings" and access it later from "view callable" by invoking request.registry.setting dictionary at application runtime.


Request Processing

	Skipped. Although I've read this portion.


URL Dispatch:
	1. "config" below is presumed to be an instance of the pyramid.config.Configurator class; "myview" is assumed to be a "view callable" function
	from myproject.views import myview
	config.add_route('myroute', '/prefix/{one}/{two}', view=myview)
	2. "config" below is presumed to be an instance of the pyramid.config.Configurator class; "myview" is assumed to be a "view callable" function
	config.add_route('myroute', '/prefix/{one}/{two}', view='myproject.views.myview')

# Route pattern syntax:

	pattern: {foo}/bar/baz equals to /{foo}/bar/baz, if the pattern does not start with a "/", the slash will be prepended automatically anyway in matching time.

	pattern: foo/{baz}/{bar}
	url: foo/1/2        -> {'baz':u'1', 'bar':u'2'}
	url: foo/abc/def    -> {'baz':u'abc', 'bar':u'def'}
	url: foo/1/2/        -> No match (trailing slash)
	url: bar/abc/def     -> First segment literal mismatch
	And the the matched dict will be availabe as "request.matchdic"

	pattern: foo/{name}.html
	url: /foo/biz.html  -> {'name':u'biz'}

	pattern: foo/{name}.{ext}
	url: /foo/biz.html  -> {'name':u'biz', 'ext':u'html'}

	regular expession pattern: {foo} is actually: {foo:[^/]+} by default means: matches one or more characters which are not a slash, you can also change it to {foo:\d+} to match only digits.

	** jiawzhang notes: the pattern above "{foo}/bar/baz" actually internally is like this: "^/{foo}/bar/baz$" ==> "^/([^/]+)/bar/baz$" slash is automatically prepended with ^,$ **

	regular expression pattern: foo/{bar}
	foo/La%20Pe%C3%B1a  -> {'bar':u'La Pe\xf1a'}
	The matchdict will be URL-decoded / UTF-8 decoded.

	If the pattern has a * in it, the name which follows it is considered a “remainder match”. A remainder match must come at the end of the pattern.
	Unlike segment replacement markers, it does not need to be preceded by a slash. For example:
	regular expression pattern: foo/{baz}/{bar}*fizzle
	foo/1/2/           ->	{'baz':u'1', 'bar':u'2', 'fizzle':()}
	foo/abc/def/a/b/c  ->	{'baz':u'abc', 'bar':u'def', 'fizzle':(u'a', u'b', u'c')}

	regular expression way to the similar things for above:
	foo/{baz}/{bar}{fizzle:.*}
	foo/1/2/           -> {'baz':u'1', 'bar':u'2', 'fizzle':u''}
	foo/abc/def/a/b/c  -> {'baz':u'abc', 'bar':u'def', 'fizzle': u'a/b/c')}
	This occurs because the default regular expression for a marker is [^/]+ which will match everything up to the first /, while {fizzle:.*} will result in a regular expression match of .* capturing the remainder into a single value.

# Route Declaration Ordering:
	memebers/{def}
	memebers/abc
	The "memebers/abc" will never be matched, since the ordering will always match the members/{def} first.

# The Matchdict
	request.matchdict will contain the values that match replacement patterns in the pattern element. The keys in a matchdict will be strings. The values will be Unicode objects.
	If no route URL pattern matches, the matchdict object attached to the request will be None.

# The Matched Route
	The matched route is availabe as "request.matched_route", the useful attribute of this object is the "name" attribute, if no route url pattern matches, request.matched_route is None.

# Route Examples:
	Example 3:
	An example of using a route with a factory:
	config.add_route('idea', 'ideas/{idea}', view='myproject.views.idea_view', factory='myproject.resources.Idea')
	The above route will manufacture an Idea resource as a context, assuming that mypackage.resources.Idea resolves to a class that accepts a request in its __init__. For example:
	class Idea(object):
		def __init__(self, request):
			pass
	In a more complicated application, this root factory might be a class representing a SQLAlchemy model.
	
	Example 4:
	config.add_route('idea', 'site/{id}')
	config.add_view(route_name='idea', view='mypackage.views.site_view')
	are same to
	config.add_route('idea', 'site/{id}', view='mypackage.views.site_view')

# Matching the Root URL
	config.add_route('root', '', view='mypackage.views.root_view')
	Or provide the literal string / as the pattern:
	config.add_route('root', '/', view='mypackage.views.root_view')

# Generating Route URLs

	If you’ve configured a route with the name “foo” and the pattern “{a}/{b}/{c}”, you might do this, for example: config.add_route('foo', '{a}/{b}/{c}')

	1 pyramid.request.Request.route_url()
	  url = request.route_url('foo', a='1', b='2', c='3')
	  This would return the string http://example.com/1/2/3 (at least if the current protocol and hostname implied http://example.com).
	2 pyramid.request.Request.route_path()
	  url = request.route_path('foo', a='1', b='2', c='3')
	  This would return the string /1/2/3 rather than a full URL.
	3 More examples
	  config.add_route('abc', 'a/b/c/*foo')
	  url = request.route_path('abc', foo=u'Québec/biz')
	  or
	  url = request.route_path('abc', foo=(u'Québec', u'biz'))
	  will both return '/a/b/c/Qu%C3%A9bec/biz'

# Static Routes
	config = Configurator()
	config.add_route('page', '/page/{action}', static=True)
	With the static=True, the route 'page' will be used to the purpose on generating URL only, not for matching.

# Redirecting to Slash-Appended Routes

	##############################################################
	from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPNotFound
	from pyramid.view import notfound_view_config, view_config

	@notfound_view_config(append_slash=True)
	def notfound(request):
		return HTTPNotFound('Not found, bro.')

	@view_config(route_name='noslash')
	def no_slash(request):
		return Response('No slash')

	@view_config(route_name='hasslash')
	def has_slash(request):
		return Response('Has slash')

	def main(g, **settings):
		config = Configurator()
		config.add_route('noslash', 'no_slash')
		config.add_route('hasslash', 'has_slash/')
		config.scan()
	##############################################################

	This will make sure the url path like "/has_slash" to be redirect to "/has_slash/", however "/noslash/" will still go to "Not found, bro." page. And it is same to below code snippet:

	##############################################################
	from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPNotFound

	def notfound(request):
		return HTTPNotFound('Not found, bro.')

	def no_slash(request):
		return Response('No slash')

	def has_slash(request):
		return Response('Has slash')

	def main(g, **settings):
		config = Configurator()
		config.add_route('noslash', 'no_slash')
		config.add_route('hasslash', 'has_slash/')
		config.add_view(no_slash, route_name='noslash')
		config.add_view(has_slash, route_name='hasslash')
		config.add_notfound_view(notfound, append_slash=True)
	##############################################################

# Debugging Route Matching
	jiawzhang@home-pc:~$ PYRAMID_DEBUG_ROUTEMATCH=true bin/pserve development.ini

# Using a Route Prefix to Compose Applications

	##############################################################
	from pyramid.config import Configurator

	def users_include(config):
		config.add_route('show_users', '/show')

	def main(global_config, **settings):
		config = Configurator()
		config.include(users_include, route_prefix='/users')
	##############################################################
	
	In the above configuration, the show_users route will have an effective route pattern of /users/show, instead of /show because the route_prefix argument will be prepended to the pattern.

	Route prefixes are recursive, so if a callable executed via an include itself turns around and includes another callable, the second-level route prefix will be prepended with the first:
	##############################################################
	from pyramid.config import Configurator

	def timing_include(config):
		config.add_route('show_times', /times')

	def users_include(config):
		config.add_route('show_users', '/show')
		config.include(timing_include, route_prefix='/timing')

	def main(global_config, **settings):
		config = Configurator()
		config.include(users_include, route_prefix='/users')
	##############################################################

	In the above configuration, the show_users route will still have an effective route pattern of /users/show. The show_times route however, will have an effective pattern of /users/timing/times.

# Custom Route Predicates

	info['match'] is useful when predicates need access to the route match. For example:

	def any_of(segment_name, *allowed):
	    def predicate(info, request):
	        if info['match'][segment_name] in allowed:
	            return True
	    return predicate
	num_one_two_or_three = any_of('num', 'one', 'two', 'three')
	config.add_route('num', '/{num}', custom_predicates=(num_one_two_or_three,))
	
	This will ensure the "num" segment here is one of the values one, two or three.

	info['route'] is an object has two useful attributes: name and pattern
	1  def twenty_ten(info, request):
	2      if info['route'].name in ('ymd', 'ym', 'y'):
	3          return info['match']['year'] == '2010'
	4
	5  config.add_route('y', '/{year}', custom_predicates=(twenty_ten,))
	6  config.add_route('ym', '/{year}/{month}', custom_predicates=(twenty_ten,))
	7  config.add_route('ymd', '/{year}/{month}/{day}',
	8                   custom_predicates=(twenty_ten,))
	The above predicate, when added to a number of route configurations ensures that the year match argument is ‘2010’ if and only if the route name is ‘ymd’, ‘ym’, or ‘y’.

# Using Pyramid Security With URL Dispatch
	allow the editor the view permission:
	class Article(object):
		def __init__(self, request):
		   matchdict = request.matchdict
		   article = matchdict.get('article', None)
		   if article == '1':
			   self.__acl__ = [ (Allow, 'editor', 'view') ]


Views


# Defining a View Callable as a Function

	1 from pyramid.response import Response
	2
	3 def hello_world(request):
	4     return Response('Hello world!')

# Defining a View Callable as a Class

	Views defined as classes must have the following traits:
	• an __init__ method that accepts a request argument.
	• a __call__ (or other) method that accepts no parameters and which returns a response.

	1 from pyramid.response import Response
	2
	3 class MyView(object):
	4     def __init__(self, request):
	5         self.request = request
	6
	7     def __call__(self):
	8         return Response('hello')

	If you want to access "context", try "request.context"

# View Callable Responses

	1 from pyramid.response import Response
	2
	3 def view(request):
	4     return Response('OK')

	You don’t need to always use Response to represent a response like HTTPFound in pyramid.httpexceptions can be returned too. A view can actually return any object that has the following attributes.

	status: The HTTP status code (including the name) for the response as a string. E.g. 200 OK or 401 Unauthorized.
	headerlist: A sequence of tuples representing the list of headers that should be set in the response. E.g. [('Content-Type', 'text/html'), ('Content-Length', '412')]
	app_iter: An iterable representing the body of the response. This can be a list, e.g. ['<html><head></head><body>Hello world!</body></html>'] or it can be a file-like object, or any other sort of iterable.

# Using Special Exceptions In View Callables

	HTTP Exceptions

		The pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPUnauthorized exception can be raised. This will cause a response to be generated with a 401 Unauthorized status:

		1 from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPUnauthorized
		2
		3 def aview(request):
		4	 raise HTTPUnauthorized()

		An HTTP exception, instead of being raised, can alternately be returned (HTTP exceptions are also valid response objects):

		1 from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPUnauthorized
		2
		3 def aview(request):
		4	return HTTPUnauthorized()
		
		Instead of importing and constructing a HTTPUnauthorized response object, you can use the exception_response() function to construct and return the same object.

		1 from pyramid.httpexceptions import exception_response
		2 
		3 def aview(request):
		4	raise exception_response(401)

	How Pyramid Uses HTTP Exceptions

		Usually when a Python exception is raised within a view callable, Except pyramid.exceptions.NotFound and pyramid.exceptions.Forbidden,
		Pyramid allows all the other exception to propagate all the way out to the WSGI server which invoked the application.
		The two special exceptions accept a single positional constructor argument: a message.
		If NotFound is raised within view code, the result of the Not Found View will be returned to the user agent which performed the request.
		If Forbidden is raised within view code, the result of the Forbidden View will be returned to the user agent which performed the request.
		In all cases, the message provided to the exception constructor is made available to the view which Pyramid invokes as request.exception.args[0].

# Custom Exception Views

	For example, given the following exception class in a module named helloworld.exceptions:

	1 class ValidationFailure(Exception):
	2     def __init__(self, msg):
	3         self.msg = msg

	You can wire a view callable to be called whenever any of your other code raises a hellworld.exceptions.ValidationFailure exception:

	1 from helloworld.exceptions import ValidationFailure
	2
	3 @view_config(context=ValidationFailure)
	4 def failed_validation(exc, request):
	5     response =  Response('Failed validation: %s' % exc.msg)
	6     response.status_int = 500
	7     return response

	This view callable will be invoked whenever a helloworld.exceptions.ValidationError is raised by your application’s view code.

	Other normal view predicates can also be used in combination with an exception view registration:

	1 from pyramid.view import view_config
	2 from helloworld.exceptions import ValidationFailure
	3
	4 @view_config(context=ValidationFailure, route_name='home')
	5 def failed_validation(exc, request):
	6	response =  Response('Failed validation: %s' % exc.msg)
	7	response.status_int = 500
	8	return response

	The above exception view names the route_name of home, meaning that it will only be called when the route matched has a name of home.
	
	Normal (i.e., non-exception) views registered against a context resource type which inherits from Exception will work normally. 

	1 from pyramid.view import view_config
	2 from pyramid.exceptions import NotFound
	3 from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPNotFound
	4
	5 @view_config(context=NotFound, route_name='home')
	6 def notfound_view(request):
	7     return HTTPNotFound()

# Using a View Callable to Do an HTTP Redirect

	You can issue an HTTP redirect from within a view by returning a particular kind of response.

	1 from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPFound
	2
	3 def myview(request):
	4     return HTTPFound(location='http://example.com')
	4	  raise HTTPFound(location='http://example.com') # this is correct either.

	All exception types from the pyramid.httpexceptions module implement the Response interface; any can be returned as the response from a view.
	It also includes other response types that imply other HTTP response codes, such as HTTPUnauthorized for 401 Unauthorized.
					
# Handling Form Submissions in View Callables (Unicode and Character Set Issues)

	As an example, let’s assume that the following form page is served up to a browser client, and its action points at some Pyramid view code:

	1 <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	2   <head>
	3     <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>
	4   </head>
	5   <form method="POST" action="myview">
	6     <div>
	7       <input type="text" name="firstname"/>
	8     </div>
	9     <div>
	10       <input type="text" name="lastname"/>
	11     </div>
	12     <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
	13   </form>
	14 </html>

	The values below in the request is converted from UTF-8 to Unicode implicitily.

	1 def myview(request):
	2     firstname = request.params['firstname']
	3     lastname = request.params['lastname']

	So make sure "charset=UTF-8" is always set in HTML head meta tag, otherwise this implicitily convertion will be failed.
	Since this implicitily convertion from UTF-8 to Unicode happens already, don't do this once again like: reqeust.params['firstname'].decode('utf-8')
	This convertion will happen only in reqeust.params, request.GET, request.POST
				 
Renderers

	A view needn’t always return a Response object. If a view happens to return something which does not implement the Pyramid Response interface,
	Pyramid will attempt to use a renderer to construct a response. For example:

	from pyramid.response import Response
	from pyramid.view import view_config

	@view_config(renderer='json')
	def hello_world(request):
		return {'content':'Hello!'}
	
	Means, you should either return a "Reponse" or specify a "renderer" to construct a respose.

# Writing View Callables Which Use a Renderer

	1 config.add_view('myproject.views.my_view', renderer='json')

	Returning Response object directly will overwrite specifying renderer.
	For example, if your view callable returns an instance of the pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPFound class as a response, no renderer will be employed.

	1 from pyramid.response import Response
	2 from pyramid.view import view_config
	3
	4 @view_config(renderer='json')
	5 def view(request):
	6     return Response('OK') # json renderer avoided, because Reponse is returned here.

	Likewise for an HTTP exception response:

	1 from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPFound
	2 from pyramid.view import view_config
	3
	4 @view_config(renderer='json')
	5 def view(request):
	6     return HTTPFound(location='http://example.com') # json renderer avoided

	You can of course also return the request.response attribute instead to avoid rendering:

	6     request.response.body = 'OK'
    7     return request.response # json renderer avoided


# Built-In Renderers
	1. string:String Render

		@view_config(renderer='string')
		def hello_world(request):
			return {'content':'Hello!'}

	2. json:JSON Render

		@view_config(renderer='json')
		def hello_world(request):
			return {'content':'Hello!'}
		
		OR use the JSON renderer by using config.add_view():

		config.add_view('myproject.views.hello_world', name='hello', context='myproject.resources.Hello', renderer='json')
		
		@view_config and config.add_view() are actually same thing.

	3. JSONP Render

		1 from pyramid.config import Configurator
		2
		3 config = Configurator()
		4 config.add_renderer('jsonp', JSONP(param_name='callback'))

		1 from pyramid.view import view_config
		2
		3 @view_config(renderer='jsonp')
		4 def myview(request):
		5     return {'greeting':'Hello world'}

		When a view is called that uses a JSONP renderer:
		If there is a parameter in the request’s HTTP query string (aka request.GET) that matches the param_name of the registered JSONP renderer (by default, callback), the renderer will return a JSONP response.
		If there is no callback parameter in the request’s query string, the renderer will return a ‘plain’ JSON response.

		For example (Javascript):
		var api_url = 'http://api.geonames.org/timezoneJSON' +
					  '?lat=38.301733840000004' +
					  '&lng=-77.45869621' +
					  '&username=fred' +
					  '&callback=?';
		jqhxr = $.getJSON(api_url);

	4. *.pt or *.txt: Chameleon Template Renders

	1) relative path is different from Mako, which means relative to the path which defines the view callable. 
	config.add_view('myproject.views.hello_world', name='hello', context='myproject.resources.Hello', renderer='templates/foo.pt')

	2) asset specification, same to Mako.
	config.add_view('myproject.views.hello_world', name='hello', context='myproject.resources.Hello', renderer='myproject:templates/foo.pt')
	config.add_view('myproject.views.hello_world', name='hello', context='myproject.resources.Hello', renderer='myproject:templates/foo.txt')

	5. *.mak or *.mako: Mako Template Render
	
	The Mako template renderer renders views using a Mako template. When used, the view must return a Response object or a Python dictionary. 

	1) relative path(The relative 'foo.mako' below is not relative to the package, but is relative to the directory configured for Mako via the mako.directories configuration file setting, for example, mako.directories = mypackage:templates):
	config.add_view('myproject.views.hello_world', name='hello', context='myproject.resources.Hello', renderer='foo.mako')

	2) asset specification(e.g. apackage:templates/sometemplate.mak):
	config.add_view('myproject.views.hello_world', name='hello', context='myproject.resources.Hello', renderer='mypackage:templates/foo.mak')

# Varying Attributes of Rendered Responses

	View callables that don’t directly return a response should set these attributes on the request object via setattr during their execution, to influence associated response attributes.
	If return a response directly, you can set attributes on Response object I think, see later.

	For example:

	from pyramid.view import view_config

	@view_config(name='gone', renderer='templates/gone.pt')
	def myview(request):
		request.response.status = '404 Not Found'
		return {'URL':request.URL}
	
	The sample above is useful to customize a notfound view by renderer with dict data rather than just returning HTTPNotFound response.
	
	The following example calls request.response.set_cookie, but this call will have no effect, because a different Response object is returned.

	1 from pyramid.response import Response
	2
	3 def view(request):
	4     request.response.set_cookie('abc', '123') # this has no effect
	5     return Response('OK') # because we're returning a different response

	If you mutate request.response and you’d like the mutations to have an effect, you must return request.response:

	1 def view(request):
	2     request.response.set_cookie('abc', '123')
	3     return request.response

Templates

# Using Templates Directly

	In this section, it's actually return Response rather than specifying renderer.

	1 from pyramid.renderers import render_to_response
	2
	3 def sample_view(request):
	4     return render_to_response('mypackage:templates/foo.mako',
	5                               {'foo':1, 'bar':2},
	6                               request=request)

	render_to_response() here is an extension api for the native template api offered by a giving template engine like Chameleon or Mako.

	Or, you can generate string first, then construct the response like below, it's same to above.

	1 from pyramid.renderers import render
	2 from pyramid.response import Response
	3
	4 def sample_view(request):
	5     result = render('mypackage:templates/foo.pt',
	6                     {'foo':1, 'bar':2},
	7                     request=request)
	8     response = Response(result)
	9     return response

	It's also doable to invoke your own 3rd party template Apis in view callable, since you can construct Response like above.
	See more: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/narr/templates.html#templates-used-as-renderers-via-configuration

	If you want to control more about response, do something like below:
	7     response.content_type = 'text/plain'
	8     response.status_int = 204

# System Values Used During Rendering
	context
	    The current Pyramid context if request was provided as a keyword argument, or None.
	request
		The request provided as a keyword argument.
	renderer_name
		The renderer name used to perform the rendering, e.g. mypackage:templates/foo.pt.
	renderer_info
		An object implementing the pyramid.interfaces.IRendererInfo interface. Basically, an object with the following attributes: name, package and type.
	These variables are made as top-level template variables, you can access them in template by something like ${request}, ${render_info.name}

# Templates Used as Renderers via Configuration

	1 from pyramid.view import view_config
	2
	3 @view_config(renderer='templates/foo.pt')
	4 def my_view(request):
	5     return {'foo':1, 'bar':2}

	This is a better way compared with "# Using Template Directly"
	if you want to do the same thing in "# Using Template Directly" to control more about response, you should set request rather than response, see: "# Varying Attributes of Rendered Responses"

# Templating With Mako Templates

	from pyramid.view import view_config

	@view_config(renderer='foo.mak')
	def my_view(request):
		return {'project':'my project'}

	For the above view callable to work, the following setting needs to be present in the application stanza of your configuration’s ini file:
	mako.directories = mypackage:templates
	And make sure you will have "foo.mak" in your "mypackage:templates" folder, "foo.mak" here is relative to "mypackage:templates" we defined.

# View Configuration Using the @view_config Decorator
	It's a better way compared with imperative configuration for the same purpose.

	An example of the view_config decorator might reside in a Pyramid application module views.py:

	1 from resources import MyResource
	2 from pyramid.view import view_config
	3 from pyramid.response import Response
	4
	5 @view_config(route_name='ok', request_method='POST', permission='read')
	6 def my_view(request):
	7     return Response('OK')

	Using this decorator as above replaces the need to add this imperative configuration stanza:

	1 config.add_view('mypackage.views.my_view', route_name='ok',
	2                 request_method='POST', permission='read')

	All arguments to view_config may be omitted. For example:

	1 from pyramid.response import Response
	2 from pyramid.view import view_config
	3
	4 @view_config()
	5 def my_view(request):
	6     """ My view """
	7     return Response()

	To make Pyramid process your view_config declarations, you must do use the scan method of a Configurator:

	1 # config is assumed to be an instance of the
	2 # pyramid.config.Configurator class
	3 config.scan()

@view_config Placement

	A view_config decorator can be placed in various points in your application.

	If your view callable is a function, it may be used as a function decorator:

	1 from pyramid.view import view_config
	2 from pyramid.response import Response
	3
	4 @view_config(route_name='edit')
	5 def edit(request):
	6     return Response('edited!')

	If your view callable is a class, the decorator can also be used as a class decorator in Python 2.6 and better (Python 2.5 and below do not support class decorators).

	1 from pyramid.response import Response
	2 from pyramid.view import view_config
    3
	4 @view_config(route_name='hello')
	5 class MyView(object):
    6     def __init__(self, request):
    7         self.request = request
	8
	9     def __call__(self):
	10         return Response('hello')

	More than one view_config decorator can be stacked on top of any number of others. Each decorator creates a separate view registration. For example:

	from pyramid.view import view_config
	from pyramid.response import Response

	@view_config(route_name='edit')
	@view_config(route_name='change')
	def edit(request):
		    return Response('edited!')

	This registers the same view under two different names.

	The decorator can also be used against class methods:

	 from pyramid.response import Response
	 from pyramid.view import view_config

	 class MyView(object):
		 def __init__(self, request):
			 self.request = request

		 @view_config(route_name='hello')
		 def amethod(self):
			 return Response('hello')

	The code above is equivalent/same to below, means by default it will invoke __call__ method in class, but add a non-predicate paramter "attr" can specify a method you want to be called,
	when the view callable is invoked.

	from pyramid.response import Response
	from pyramid.view import view_config

	@view_config(attr='amethod', route_name='hello')
	class MyView(object):
	    def __init__(self, request):
            self.request = request

	    def amethod(self):
	        return Response('hello')

# View Registration Using add_view()

	1 from pyramid.response import Response
	2
	3 def hello_world(request):
	4     return Response('hello!')
	5
	6 # config is assumed to be an instance of the
	7 # pyramid.config.Configurator class
	8 config.add_view(hello_world, route_name='hello')

# @view_defaults Class Decorator

	1) Instead of this:

	from pyramid.view import view_config
	from pyramid.response import Response

	class RESTView(object):
		def __init__(self, request):
			self.request = request

		@view_config(route_name='rest', request_method='GET')
		def get(self):
			return Response('get')

		@view_config(route_name='rest', request_method='POST')
		def post(self):
			return Response('post')

		@view_config(route_name='rest', request_method='DELETE')
		def delete(self):
			return Response('delete')

	You can do this:

	from pyramid.view import view_defaults
	from pyramid.view import view_config
	from pyramid.response import Response

	@view_defaults(route_name='rest')
	class RESTView(object):
		def __init__(self, request):
			self.request = request

		@view_config(request_method='GET')
		def get(self):
			return Response('get')

		@view_config(request_method='POST')
		def post(self):
			return Response('post')

		@view_config(request_method='DELETE')
		def delete(self):
			return Response('delete')

	2) Instead of this:

	from pyramid.response import Response
	from pyramid.config import Configurator

	class RESTView(object):
		def __init__(self, request):
			self.request = request

		def get(self):
			return Response('get')

		def post(self):
			return Response('post')

		def delete(self):
			return Response('delete')

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		config = Configurator()
		config.add_route('rest', '/rest')
		config.add_view(
			RESTView, route_name='rest', attr='get', request_method='GET')
		config.add_view(
			RESTView, route_name='rest', attr='post', request_method='POST')
		config.add_view(
			RESTView, route_name='rest', attr='delete', request_method='DELETE')

	To reduce the amount of repetion in the config.add_view statements,
	we can move the route_name='rest' argument to a @view_default class decorator on the RESTView class:

	from pyramid.view import view_config
	from pyramid.response import Response
	from pyramid.config import Configurator

	@view_defaults(route_name='rest')
	class RESTView(object):
		def __init__(self, request):
			self.request = request

		def get(self):
			return Response('get')

		def post(self):
			return Response('post')

		def delete(self):
			return Response('delete')

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		config = Configurator()
		config.add_route('rest', '/rest')
		config.add_view(RESTView, attr='get', request_method='GET')
		config.add_view(RESTView, attr='post', request_method='POST')
		config.add_view(RESTView, attr='delete', request_method='DELETE')

	Normal Python inheritance rules apply to defaults added via view_defaults. For example:

	@view_defaults(route_name='rest')
	class Foo(object):
		pass

	class Bar(Foo):
		pass

	The Bar class above will inherit its view defaults from the arguments passed to the view_defaults decorator of the Foo class.
	To prevent this from happening, use a view_defaults decorator without any arguments on the subclass:

	@view_defaults(route_name='rest')
	class Foo(object):
		pass

	@view_defaults()
	class Bar(Foo):
		pass

	The view_defaults decorator only works as a class decorator; using it against a function or a method will produce nonsensical results.

# Configuring View Security

	1 # config is an instance of pyramid.config.Configurator
	2
	3 config.add_route('add', '/add.html', factory='mypackage.Blog')
	4 config.add_view('myproject.views.add_entry', route_name='add',
					  permission='add')

	When an authorization policy is enabled, this view will be protected with the add permission.
	The view will not be called if the user does not possess the add permission relative to the current context.
	Instead the forbidden view result will be returned to the client as per Protecting Views with Permissions.
	Question: In Router based pyramid, the context here is always "root" ?

# NotFound Errors:

	Set use PYRAMID_DEBUG_NOTFOUND environment variable or debug_notfound = True in configuration .ini file will tell you why a view was not found from stderr, and browser representation of the error will include the same information.

# Influencing HTTP Caching

	Pyramid will set Expires and Cache-Control response headers in the resulting response,
	causing browsers to cache the response data from some time by using Non-Predicate argument: set http_cache as below
	In some case, there is an alternate branch(if/else) you don't hope to cache response even if you set http_cache, you can use prevent_auto as below

	from pyramid.view import view_config

	@view_config(http_cache=3600)
	def view(request):
		response = Response()
		if not 'should_cache' in request.params:
			response.cache_control.prevent_auto = True
		return response
	
	Turn off http_cache entirely for the duration of a Pyramid application lifetime:
	To do so, set the PYRAMID_PREVENT_HTTP_CACHE environment variable or the pyramid.prevent_http_cache configuration value setting to a true value. 


Static Assets

# Serving Static Assets
	1) absolute path:
	1 # config is an instance of pyramid.config.Configurator
	2 config.add_static_view(name='static', path='/var/www/static')

	In the example above, name is static, and path is /var/www/static.
	In English, this means that you wish to serve the files that live in /var/www/static as sub-URLs of the /static URL prefix. Therefore, the file /var/www/static/foo.css will be
	returned when the user visits your application’s URL /static/foo.css.

	2) asset specification
	1 # config is an instance of pyramid.config.Configurator
	2 config.add_static_view(name='static', path='some_package:a/b/c/static')

	3) "name" argument is a external URL:
	1 # config is an instance of pyramid.config.Configurator
	2 config.add_static_view(name='http://example.com/images',
	3                        path='mypackage:images')
	In this mode, the name is used as the URL prefix when generating a URL using pyramid.url.static_url(). Static assets can be served from external web server.

# Generating Static Asset URLs
	1) URL Prefix way:
	For example, let’s assume you create a set of static declarations like so:

	1 config.add_static_view(name='static1', path='mypackage:assets/1')
	2 config.add_static_view(name='static2', path='mypackage:assets/2')

	You needn’t generate the URLs to static assets “by hand” in such a configuration. Instead, use the static_url() API to generate them for you. For example:

	1 from pyramid.chameleon_zpt import render_template_to_response
	2
	3 def my_view(request):
	4     css_url = request.static_url('mypackage:assets/1/foo.css')
	5     js_url = request.static_url('mypackage:assets/2/foo.js')
	6     return render_template_to_response('templates/my_template.pt',
	7                                        css_url = css_url,
	8                                        js_url = js_url)

	If the request “application URL” of the running system is http://example.com, the css_url generated above would be: http://example.com/static1/foo.css.
	The js_url generated above would be http://example.com/static2/foo.js.

	One benefit of using the static_url() function rather than constructing static URLs “by hand” is that if you need to change the name of a static URL declaration, the generated URLs will continue to resolve properly after the rename.

	2) URL way:
	URLs may also be generated by static_url() to static assets that live outside the Pyramid application(like in apache/nginx side):
	1 config.add_static_view(name='http://example.com/images',
	2                        path='mypackage:images')

	Under such a configuration, the URL generated by static_url for assets which begin with mypackage:images will be prefixed with http://example.com/images:

	1 request.static_url('mypackage:images/logo.png')
	2 # -> http://example.com/images/logo.png

	You can use URL Prefix way in development while URL way in production, set a URL Prefix in development.ini while set a URL in production.ini
	We suggest using the pyramid.registry.Registry.settings API in conjunction with a setting in the application .ini file named like for example "media_location" as the key.

# Advanced: Serving Static Assets Using a View Callable

	There are two cases below you need View Callable to serve static assets:
	1) If you’re using URL dispatch, you may want static assets to only be available as a fallback if no previous route matches.
	2) For protecting static assets with a permission, authentication or can be configured to respond under different circumstances using view predicate arguments.
	Note that you cannot use the static_url() API to generate URLs against assets made accessible by registering a custom static view (for both two cases below).

	[1] Root-Relative Custom Static View (URL Dispatch Only)

	Create an instance of the static class inside a static.py file in your application root as below.

	1 from pyramid.view import static_view
	2 static_view = static_view('mypackage:static', use_subpath=True)
	2 static_view = static_view('/path/to/static/dir', use_subpath=True)

	Subsequently, you may wire the files that are served by this view up to be accessible as /<filename> using a configuration method in your application’s startup code.

	1 # .. every other add_route declaration should come
	2 # before this one, as it will, by default, catch all requests later.
	3
	4 config.add_route('catchall_static', '/*subpath', 'myapp.static.static_view')

	The special name *subpath (see *fizzle for more explanation) above is used by the static view callable to signify the path of the file relative to the directory you’re serving.

    [2] Registering A View Callable to Serve a “Static” Asset

	1 import os
	2 from pyramid.response import FileResponse
	3
	4 def favicon_view(request):
	5     here = os.path.dirname(__file__)
	6     icon = open(os.path.join(here, 'static', 'favicon.ico'))
	7     return FileResponse(icon, request=request)

	You might register such a view via configuration as a view callable that should be called as the result of a traversal:

	1 config.add_view('myapp.views.favicon_view', name='favicon.ico')

	Or you might register it to be the view callable for a particular route:

	1 config.add_route('favicon', '/favicon.ico',
	2                  view='myapp.views.favicon_view')

# Overriding Assets:
	Skipped.
	This feature is something like changing the skin of the site.
	Asset overrides can actually override assets other than templates and static files. 
	Check it out: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/narr/assets.html


Request and Response Objects

# Request

	pyramid.request.Request

	req.method:
		The request method, e.g., 'GET', 'POST'
	req.GET:
		A multidict with all the variables in the query string.
	req.POST:
		A multidict with all the variables in the request body. This only has variables if the request was a POST and it is a form submission.
	req.params:
		A multidict with a combination of everything in req.GET and req.POST.
	req.body:
		The contents of the body of the request. This contains the entire request body as a string. This is useful when the request is a POST that is not a form submission, or a request like a PUT. You can also get req.body_file for a file-like object.
	req.json_body:
		The JSON-decoded contents of the body of the request. See Dealing With A JSON-Encoded Request Body.
	req.cookies:
		A simple dictionary of all the cookies.
	req.headers:
		A dictionary of all the headers. This dictionary is case-insensitive.
	req.urlvars and req.urlargs:
		req.urlvars are the keyword parameters associated with the request URL. req.urlargs are the positional parameters. These are set by products like Routes and Selector.

	Also, for standard HTTP request headers there are usually attributes, for instance: req.accept_language, req.content_length, req.user_agent, as an example. These properties expose the parsed form of each header, for whatever parsing makes sense. For instance, req.if_modified_since returns a datetime object (or None if the header is was not provided).

	In addition to these attributes, there are several ways to get the URL of the request. I’ll show various values for an example URL http://localhost/app/blog?id=10, where the application is mounted at http://localhost/app.

	req.url:
		The full request URL, with query string, e.g., http://localhost/app/blog?id=10
	req.host:
		The host information in the URL, e.g., localhost
	req.host_url:
		The URL with the host, e.g., http://localhost
	req.application_url:
		The URL of the application (just the SCRIPT_NAME portion of the path, not PATH_INFO). E.g., http://localhost/app
	req.path_url:
		The URL of the application including the PATH_INFO. e.g., http://localhost/app/blog
	req.path:
		The URL including PATH_INFO without the host or scheme. e.g., /app/blog
	req.path_qs:
		The URL including PATH_INFO and the query string. e.g, /app/blog?id=10
	req.query_string:
		The query string in the URL, e.g., id=10
	req.relative_url(url, to_application=False):
		Gives a URL, relative to the current URL. If to_application is True, then resolves it relative to req.application_url. 
	
# Methods on Request / Unicode:
	Skipped:
	Check out: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/narr/webob.html

# Multidict
	?pref=red&pref=blue
	request.GET('pref') => 'blue'
	request.GET.getall('pref') => 'red', 'blue'
	request.GET.getone('pref') => exception, this is no issue only when there is one and only one value for 'pref'
	request.GET.items() => [('pref', 'red'), ('pref', 'blue')]
	request.GET.keys() => ['pref', 'pref'].
	Multidict is a view on a list of tuples; all the keys are ordered, and all the values are ordered.

# Dealing With A JSON-Encoded Request Body

	Here’s how to construct an AJAX request in Javascript using jQuery that allows you to use the request.json_body attribute when the request is sent to a Pyramid application:

	jQuery.ajax({type:'POST',
				 url: 'http://localhost:6543/', // the pyramid server
				 data: JSON.stringify({'a':1}),
				 contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8'});

	When such a request reaches a view in your application, the request.json_body attribute will be available in the view callable body.

	@view_config(renderer='string')
	def aview(request):
		print request.json_body
		return 'OK'

	For the above view, printed to the console will be:

	{u'a': 1}

# Cleaning Up After a Request

	from mypackage.models import DBSession

	from pyramid.events import subscriber
	from pyramid.events import NewRequest

	def cleanup_callback(request):
		DBSession.remove()

	@subscriber(NewRequest)
	def add_cleanup_callback(event):
		event.request.add_finished_callback(cleanup_callback)
	
	Note: this is only an example, we don't need DBSession.remove() like this in reality. Because in Pyramid scaffold, pyramid_tm has take care of this.

# Response

	pyramid.response.Response

	response.status:
		The response code plus reason message, like '200 OK'. To set the code without a message, use status_int, i.e.: response.status_int = 200.
	response.headerlist:
		A list of all the headers, like [('Content-Type', 'text/html')]. There’s a case-insensitive multidict in response.headers that also allows you to access these same headers.
	response.app_iter:
		An iterable (such as a list or generator) that will produce the content of the response. This is also accessible as response.body (a string), response.unicode_body (a unicode object, informed by response.charset), and response.body_file (a file-like object; writing to it appends to app_iter).

	Everything else in the object derives from this underlying state. Here’s the highlights:

	response.content_type
		The content type not including the charset parameter. Typical use: response.content_type = 'text/html'.
	response.charset:
		The charset parameter of the content-type, it also informs encoding in response.unicode_body. response.content_type_params is a dictionary of all the parameters.
	response.set_cookie(key, value, max_age=None, path='/', ...):
		Set a cookie. The keyword arguments control the various cookie parameters. The max_age argument is the length for the cookie to live in seconds (you may also use a timedelta object). The Expires key will also be set based on the value of max_age.
	response.delete_cookie(key, path='/', domain=None):
		Delete a cookie from the client. This sets max_age to 0 and the cookie value to ''.
	response.cache_expires(seconds=0):
		This makes this response cacheable for the given number of seconds, or if seconds is 0 then the response is uncacheable (this also sets the Expires header).
	response(environ, start_response):
		The response object is a WSGI application. As an application, it acts according to how you create it. It can do conditional responses if you pass conditional_response=True when instantiating (or set that attribute later). It can also do HEAD and Range requests. 

# Instantiating the Response

	Of course most of the time you just want to make a response. Generally any attribute of the response can be passed in as a keyword argument to the class; e.g.:

	from pyramid.response import Response
	response = Response(body='hello world!', content_type='text/plain')

# Exception Responses

	For instance, pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPNotFound subclasses pyramid.Response, so you can manipulate the instances in the same way. A typical example is:

	from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPNotFound
	from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPMovedPermanently

	response = HTTPNotFound('There is no such resource')
# or:
	response = HTTPMovedPermanently(location=new_url)


Sessions

	In order to use sessions, you must set up a session factory during your Pyramid configuration.

	A very basic, insecure sample session factory implementation is provided in the Pyramid core. It uses a cookie to store session information. This implementation has the cookie limitation.

	from pyramid.session import UnencryptedCookieSessionFactoryConfig
	my_session_factory = UnencryptedCookieSessionFactoryConfig('itsaseekreet')

	from pyramid.config import Configurator
	config = Configurator(session_factory = my_session_factory)

	Access session objects:

	from pyramid.response import Response

	def myview(request):
		session = request.session
		if 'abc' in session:
			session['fred'] = 'yes'
		session['abc'] = '123'
		if 'fred' in session:
			return Response('Fred was in the session')
		else:
			return Response('Fred was not in the session')

	You can use a session much like a Python dictionary. It supports all dictionary methods, along with some extra attributes, and methods.

	Extra attributes:

	created
		An integer timestamp indicating the time that this session was created.
	new
		A boolean. If new is True, this session is new. Otherwise, it has been constituted from data that was already serialized.

	Extra methods:

	changed()
		Call this when you mutate a mutable value in the session namespace. See the gotchas below for details on when, and why you should call this.
	invalidate()
		Call this when you want to invalidate the session (dump all data, and – perhaps – set a clearing cookie).

	Some gotchas:

		* Keys and values of session data must be pickleable. This means, typically, that they are instances of basic types of objects, such as strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, integers, etc.
		* If you place a mutable value (for example, a list or a dictionary) in a session object, and you subsequently mutate that value, you must call the changed() method of the session object.

# Using Alternate Session Factories

	Beaker has support for file-based sessions, database based sessions, and encrypted cookie-based sessions. See http://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_beaker for more information about pyramid_beaker.

# Creating Your Own Session Factory

# Flash Messages

	Two main uses:
	1. To display a status message only once to the user after performing an internal redirect
	2. To allow generic code to log messages for single-time display without having direct access to an HTML template.

	flash(message, queue='', allow_duplicate=True)

	To add a message to a flash message queue, use a session object’s flash() method:

	request.session.flash('mymessage')

	The flash() method appends a message to a flash queue, creating the queue if necessary.

	You can specify a string as queue name, the default one is empty string.

	request.session.flash(msg, 'myappsqueue')

	The allow_duplicate argument defaults to True. If this is False, and you attempt to add a message value which is already present in the queue, it will not be added.

	Using the session.pop_flash Method: this will return the list of the message added, and empty the queue.

	>>> request.session.flash('info message')
	>>> request.session.pop_flash()
	['info message']
	>>> request.session.pop_flash()
	[]

	Using the session.peek_flash Method:

	>>> request.session.flash('info message')
	>>> request.session.peek_flash()
	['info message']
	>>> request.session.peek_flash()
	['info message']
	>>> request.session.pop_flash()
	['info message']
	>>> request.session.peek_flash()
	[]

# Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery Attacks

	To get the current CSRF token from the session, use the session.get_csrf_token() method.

	token = request.session.get_csrf_token()

	Set it in the hidden tag in html, and post it back to server side for verification.

	token = request.session.get_csrf_token()
	if token != request.POST['csrf_token']:
		raise ValueError('CSRF token did not match')

	In this way, we are sure the user is posting user data on our own site not others.

	Using the session.new_csrf_token Method

	It clears any existing CSRF token, creates a new CSRF token, sets the token into the session, and returns the token.

	token = request.session.new_csrf_token()


Using Events

	An event is an object broadcast by the Pyramid framework at interesting points during the lifetime of an application.
	For example, subscribing to an event can allow you to run some code as the result of every new request.

	A subscriber is a function that accepts a single argument named event:

	def mysubscriber(event):
		print event

	The above is a subscriber that simply prints the event to the console when it’s called.

	1) Configuring an Event Listener Imperatively

	from pyramid.events import NewRequest
	from subscribers import mysubscriber

	# "config" below is assumed to be an instance of a pyramid.config.Configurator object

	config.add_subscriber(mysubscriber, NewRequest)

	2) Configuring an Event Listener Using a Decorator

	from pyramid.events import NewRequest
	from pyramid.events import subscriber

	@subscriber(NewRequest)
	def mysubscriber(event):
			event.request.foo = 1

	When the subscriber() decorator is used a scan must be performed against the package containing the decorated function for the decorator to have any effect.

	Either of the above registration examples implies that every time the Pyramid framework emits an event object that supplies an pyramid.events.NewRequest interface, the mysubscriber function will be called with an event object.
	The return value of a subscriber function is ignored. Subscribers to the same event type are not guaranteed to be called in any particular order relative to each other.

# An Example

	If you create event listener functions in a subscribers.py file in your application like so:

	def handle_new_request(event):
		print 'request', event.request

	def handle_new_response(event):
		print 'response', event.response

	# config is an instance of pyramid.config.Configurator

	config.add_subscriber('myproject.subscribers.handle_new_request',
						  'pyramid.events.NewRequest')
	config.add_subscriber('myproject.subscribers.handle_new_response',
						  'pyramid.events.NewResponse')

	Under this configuration, when the application is run, each time a new request or response is detected, a message will be printed to the console.

	Each of our subscriber functions accepts an event object and prints an attribute of the event object. This begs the question: how can we know which attributes a particular event has?

	We know that pyramid.events.NewRequest event objects have a request attribute, which is a request object, because the interface defined at pyramid.interfaces.INewRequest says it must.


Environment Variables and .ini File Settings

	configuration file settings like "mako.directories" should go in the [app:main] section like:

	[app:main]
	use = egg:MyProject#app
	reload_templates = true
	debug_authorization = true

	You can also use environment variables to accomplish the same purpose for settings documented as such.

	$ PYRAMID_DEBUG_AUTHORIZATION=1 PYRAMID_RELOAD_TEMPLATES=1 bin/pserve MyProject.ini

	environment variables will overwrite the same key/value in .ini file, which will be useful in development or debug hours.

	If you want to turn all debug settings (every setting that starts with debug_). You can use PYRAMID_DEBUG_ALL=1 as an environment variable setting or you may use debug_all=true in the config file.
	If you want to turn all reload settings (every setting that starts with reload_). You can use PYRAMID_RELOAD_ALL=1 as an environment variable setting or you may use reload_all=true in the config file.

# Adding A Custom Setting

	[app:main]
    # .. other settings
    debug_frobnosticator = True

	If you’ve done any type conversion of your custom value, reset the converted values into the settings dictionary before you pass the dictionary as settings to the Configurator. For example:

	def main(global_config, **settings):
		# ...
		from pyramid.settings import asbool
		debug_frobnosticator = asbool(settings.get(
				   'debug_frobnosticator', 'false'))
		settings['debug_frobnosticator'] = debug_frobnosticator
		config = Configurator(settings=settings)

	1) Way 1 to access settings

	def includeme(config):
    settings = config.registry.settings
    debug_frobnosticator = settings['debug_frobnosticator']

	2) Way 2 to access settings

	settings = request.registry.settings
	debug_frobnosticator = settings['debug_frobnosticator']

	3) Way 3 to access settings

	registry = pyramid.threadlocal.get_current_registry()
	settings = registry.settings
	debug_frobnosticator = settings['debug_frobnosticator']

# Detailed key/value for .ini file:
	Check out more details: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/narr/environment.html


Logging

	Pyramid make use of the Python standard library logging module.

# Logging Configuration

	Check out ./MyProject/development.ini

# Sending Logging Messages

	To log messages to the package-specific logger configured in your .ini file, simply create a logger object using the __name__ builtin and call methods on it.

 import logging
 log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

 def myview(request):
     content_type = 'text/plain'
     content = 'Hello World!'
     log.debug('Returning: %s (content-type: %s)', content, content_type)
     request.response.content_type = content_type
     return request.response

This will result in the following printed to the console, on stderr:

16:20:20,440 DEBUG [myapp.views] Returning: Hello World!
                   (content-type: text/plain)

# Filtering log messages

	Check out ./MyProject/development.ini

# Advanced Configuration

	To capture log output to a separate file use a FileHandler (or a RotatingFileHandler)

	Check out ./MyProject/development.ini

# Logging Exceptions

	The logging machinery fail to log exceptions generated by Pyramid application, and pyramid_exclog package is the answer.
	1. Install pyramid_exclog:
		../bin/easy_install pyramid_exclog
	2. set production.ini file as below, when development phase, we start Pyramid app by pserve, so not to introduce pyramid_exclog like this:
		[app:myapp]
		pyramid.includes = pyramid_exclog
	These two steps above is written into ~/Dropbox/ubuntu_install_guide.sh and ./MyProject/production.ini
	
	For more details on pyramid_exclog, check out: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_exclog/en/latest/?awesome

# Request Logging with Paste's TransLogger

	I don't care this portion so far.


PasteDeploy Configuration Files

	In for example "./MyProject/production.ini", there is:
	"
		[app:main]
		use = egg:MyProject
	"
	egg:MyProject here means egg:MyProject#main, and #main is pointing at the key "main" of section "[paste.app_factory]" in "./MyProject/setup.py":
	"
		[paste.app_factory]
		main = myproject:main
	"
	And the value of "myproject:main" above represents the "main" function in myproject package(which actually means __init__.py in myproject)
	So in this way, "pserve development.ini --reload" and "uwsgi --ini-paste-logged production.ini" will finally get the "application object" created in "myproject/__init__.py/def 'main' function", and then start this "application object" by self-server or uwsgi(To start with uwsgi, uwsgi need "application object" defined only, see ~/uwsgi/myapp.py).


Command-Line Pyramid

	Your Pyramid application can be controlled and inspected using a variety of command-line utilities.

	jiawzhang TODO: Skip this first, but come back when I think this is important.

	Check out details at: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/narr/commandline.html


Internationalization and Localization

# Creating a Translation String

	1) Using The TranslationString Class

	from pyramid.i18n import TranslationString
	ts = TranslationString('Add')

	The first argument to TranslationString is the msgid; it is required. It represents the key into the translation mappings provided by a particular localization.

	from pyramid.i18n import TranslationString
	ts = TranslationString('Add ${number}', mapping={'number':1})

	Within the string above, ${number} is a replacement marker. It will be replaced by whatever is in the mapping for a translation string.


	A translation string should also usually carry a domain. The domain represents a translation category to disambiguate it from other translations of the same msgid, in case they conflict.

	from pyramid.i18n import TranslationString
	ts = TranslationString('Add ${number}', mapping={'number':1}, domain='form')

	In this case, if it were trying to translate our msgid to German, it might try to find a translation from a gettext file within a translation directory like this one:

	locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/form.mo

	In other words, it would want to take translations from the form.mo translation file in the German language.

	from pyramid.i18n import TranslationString
	ts = TranslationString('add-number', default='Add ${number}', domain='form', mapping={'number':1})

	The message identifier like 'add-number' here is mainly used to match translation in translation file, but if it fail to find one, this message identifier will be used as the default text value to be presented. In some case, this is not ideal to take message identifier for dual purpose above, so that's why we need "default" argument here. If we offer "default" argument here, this argument will be used as the default text value if no translation found in translation file.

	2) Using the TranslationStringFactory Class

	from pyramid.i18n import TranslationStringFactory
	_ = TranslationStringFactory('pyramid')
	ts = _('add-number', default='Add ${number}', mapping={'number':1})

	Note

	We assigned the translation string factory to the name _. This is a convention which will be supported by translation file generation tools.

	"pyramid" is domain name while 'Add ${number}' is default value, As a result, the previous code example is completely equivalent (except for spelling) to:

	from pyramid.i18n import TranslationString as _
	ts = _('add-number', default='Add ${number}', mapping={'number':1}, domain='pyramid')

	Creating a unique domain for your application via a translation string factory is best practice. Using your own unique translation domain allows another person to reuse your application without needing to merge your translation files with his own. Instead, he can just include your package’s translation directory via the pyramid.config.Configurator.add_translation_dirs() method.

# Working With gettext Translation Files

	The basis of Pyramid translation services is GNU gettext. GNU gettext uses three types of files in the translation framework, .pot files, .po files and .mo files.
	.pot (Portable Object Template) files -> .po (Portable Object) files -> .mo (Machine Object) files (machine-readable binary file for running faster)

	The tool for working with gettext translation files related to a Pyramid application are Babel and Lingua.

	1) Installing Babel and Lingua:
	$ cd /my/virtualenv
	$ bin/easy_install Babel lingua

	2) Changing the setup.py
	 setup(name="mypackage",
       # ...
       install_requires = [
             # ...
             'Babel',
			 'lingua',
             ],
       message_extractors = { '.': [
             ('**.py',   'lingua_python', None ),
             ('**.pt',   'lingua_xml', None ),
             ]},
       )
	Consider **.py and **.pt files when doing message id extraction.

	3) Extracting Messages from Code and Templates
	$ cd /place/where/myapplication/setup.py/lives
	$ mkdir -p myapplication/locale
	$ python setup.py extract_messages
	The message catalog .pot template will end up in: myapplication/locale/myapplication.pot.

	4) Translation Domains

	To change the translation domain of the extracted messages in your project, edit the setup.cfg file of your application, change the domain to 'mydomain' instead.
	[compile_catalog]
	directory = myproject/locale
	domain = mydomain
	statistics = true

	[extract_messages]
	add_comments = TRANSLATORS:
	output_file = myproject/locale/mydomain.pot
	width = 80

	[init_catalog]
	domain = mydomain
	input_file = myproject/locale/mydomain.pot
	output_dir = myproject/locale

	[update_catalog]
	domain = mydomain
	input_file = myproject/locale/mydomain.pot
	output_dir = myproject/locale
	previous = true

	5) Initializing a Message Catalog File
	$ cd /place/where/myapplication/setup.py/lives
	$ python setup.py init_catalog -l es

	By default, the message catalog .po file will end up in: myapplication/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/myapplication.po.

	Once the file is there, it can be worked on by a human translator. One tool which may help with this is Poedit.

	6) Updating a Catalog File

	You will need to update existing .po files based on changes to the .pot file, so that the new and changed messages can also be translated or re-translated. First, regenerate the .pot file as per 'EXtracting Messages from Code and Templates' above (step 3). Then use the setup.py update_catalog command below:

	$ cd /place/where/myapplication/setup.py/lives
	$ python setup.py update_catalog

	7) Compiling a Message Catalog File

	Finally, to prepare an application for performing actual runtime translations, compile .po files to .mo files:

	$ cd /place/where/myapplication/setup.py/lives
	$ python setup.py compile_catalog

# Using a Localizer

	pyramid.i18n.get_localizer() will return either the localizer object implied by the active locale negotiator or a default localizer object if no explicit locale negotiator is registered.

	from pyramid.i18n import get_localizer

	def aview(request):
		locale = get_localizer(request)

# Performing a Translation

	from pyramid.i18n import get_localizer
	from pyramid.i18n import TranslationString

	ts = TranslationString('Add ${number}', mapping={'number':1}, domain='pyramid')

	def aview(request):
		localizer = get_localizer(request)
		translated = localizer.translate(ts) # translation string
		# ... use translated ...

# Performing a Pluralization

	API: def pluralize(singular, plural, n, domain=None, mapping=None):
	if n is singular use the first "singular" argument as message id, otherwise use "plural" argument as message id.

	from pyramid.i18n import get_localizer

	def aview(request):
		localizer = get_localizer(request)
		translated = localizer.pluralize('Item', 'Items', 1, 'mydomain')
		# ... use translated ...

# Obtaining the Locale Name for a Request

	from pyramid.i18n import get_locale_name

	def aview(request):
		locale_name = get_locale_name(request)

	This returns the locale name negotiated by the currently active locale negotiator or the default locale name if the locale negotiator returns None.

	Once get_locale_name() is first run, the locale name is stored on the request object. Subsequent calls to get_locale_name() will return the stored locale name without invoking the locale negotiator.
	To avoid this caching, you can use the pyramid.i18n.negotiate_locale_name() function:

	from pyramid.i18n import negotiate_locale_name

	def aview(request):
		locale_name = negotiate_locale_name(request)

	You can also obtain the locale name related to a request using the locale_name attribute of a localizer.

	from pyramid.i18n import get_localizer

	def aview(request):
		localizer = get_localizer(request)
		locale_name = localizer.locale_name

# Performing Date Formatting and Currency Formatting

	Pyramid does not itself perform date and currency formatting for different locales. However, Babel can help you do this via the babel.core.Locale class. See details in http://babel.edgewall.org/wiki/ApiDocs/babel.core#babel.core:Locale

	from babel.core import Locale
	from pyramid.i18n import get_locale_name

	def aview(request):
		locale_name = get_locale_name(request)
		locale = Locale(locale_name)

# Chameleon Template Support for Translation Strings
	Skipped.

# Mako Pyramid I18N Support

	This section comes from the link: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_cookbook/en/latest/templates/mako_i18n.html

	First, add subscribers within your Pyramid project’s __init__.py:

	def main(...):
		...
		config.add_subscriber('YOURPROJECT.subscribers.add_renderer_globals',
							  'pyramid.events.BeforeRender')
		config.add_subscriber('YOURPROJECT.subscribers.add_localizer',
							  'pyramid.events.NewRequest')

	Then add, a subscribers.py module to your project’s package directory:

	# subscribers.py

	from pyramid.i18n import get_localizer, TranslationStringFactory

	def add_renderer_globals(event):
		...
		request = event['request']
		event['_'] = request.translate
		event['localizer'] = request.localizer

	tsf = TranslationStringFactory('YOUR_GETTEXT_DOMAIN')

	def add_localizer(event):
		request = event.request
		localizer = get_localizer(request)
		def auto_translate(*args, **kwargs):
			return localizer.translate(tsf(*args, **kwargs))
		request.localizer = localizer
		request.translate = auto_translate

	After this has been done, the next time you start your application, in your Mako template, you’ll be able to use the simple ${_(u"Translate this string please")} without having to use get_localizer explicitly, as its functionality will be enclosed in the _ function, which will be exposed as a top-level template name. localizer will also be available for plural forms and fancy stuff.

	This will also allow you to use translation in your view code, using something like:

	def my_view(request):
		_ = request.translate
		request.session.flash(_("Welcome home"))

	For all that to work, you’ll need to:

	(env)$ easy_install Babel

	And you’ll also need to run these commands in your project’s directory:

	(env)$ python setup.py extract_messages
	(env)$ python setup.py init_catalog -l en
	(env)$ python setup.py init_catalog -l fr
	(env)$ python setup.py init_catalog -l es
	(env)$ python setup.py init_catalog -l it
	(env)$ python setup.py update_catalog
	(env)$ python setup.py compile_catalog

	Repeat the init_catalog step for each of the langauges you need.

	At this point you’ll also need to add your local directory to your project’s configuration:

	def main(...):
		...
		config.add_translation_dirs('YOURPROJECT:locale')

	Lastly, you’ll want to have your Mako files extracted when you run extract_messages, so add these to your setup.py (yes, you read me right, in setup.py so that Babel can use it when invoking it’s commands):

	setup(
		...
		install_requires=[
			...
			Babel,
			...
			],
		message_extractors = {'yourpackage': [
				('**.py', 'python', None),
				('templates/**.html', 'mako', None),
				('templates/**.mako', 'mako', None),
				('static/**', 'ignore', None)]},
		...
		)

# Localization-Related Deployment Settings

	A Pyramid application will have a default_locale_name setting. This value represents the default locale name used when the locale negotiator returns None.

	from pyramid.config import Configurator
	config = Configurator(settings={'default_locale_name':'de'})

	You may alternately supply a default_locale_name via an application’s Paster .ini file:

	[app:main]
	use = egg:MyProject
	reload_templates = true
	debug_authorization = false
	debug_notfound = false
	default_locale_name = de

	If this value is not supplied via the Configurator constructor or via a Paste config file, it will default to en.

	If this setting is supplied within the Pyramid application .ini file, it will be available as a settings key:

	from pyramid.threadlocal import get_current_registry
	settings = get_current_registry().settings
	default_locale_name = settings['default_locale_name']

# “Detecting” Available Languages

	You can set up a system to allow a deployer to select available languages based on convention by using the pyramid.settings mechanism:

	Allow a deployer to modify your application’s PasteDeploy .ini file:

	[app:main]
	use = egg:MyProject#app
	# ...
	available_languages = fr de en ru

	Then as a part of the code of a custom locale negotiator:

	from pyramid.threadlocal import get_current_registry
	settings = get_current_registry().settings
	languages = settings['available_languages'].split()

	This is only a suggestion. You can create your own “available languages” configuration scheme as necessary.

# Activating Translation

	By default, a Pyramid application performs no translation, To turn translation on, you must:
		add at least one translation directory to your application.
		ensure that your application sets the locale name correctly.

	1) Adding a Translation Directory (jiawzhang TODO: Is this step required ?)

		Adding a translation directory registers all of its constituent message catalog files within your Pyramid application to be available to use for translation services.
		This includes all of the .mo files found within all LC_MESSAGES directories within each locale directory in the translation directory.

		from pyramid.config import Configurator
		config.add_translation_dirs('my.application:locale/', 'another.application:locale/')

		A message catalog in a translation directory added via add_translation_dirs() will be merged into translations from a message catalog added earlier if both translation directories contain translations for the same locale and translation domain.

	2) Setting the Locale

		When the default locale negotiator (see The Default Locale Negotiator) is in use, you can inform Pyramid of the current locale name by doing any of these things before any translations need to be performed:

		* Set the _LOCALE_ attribute of the request to a valid locale name (usually directly within view code). E.g. request._LOCALE_ = 'de'.
		* Ensure that a valid locale name value is in the request.params dictionary under the key named _LOCALE_. This is usually the result of passing a _LOCALE_ value in the query string or in the body of a form post associated with a request. For example, visiting http://my.application?_LOCALE_=de.
		* Ensure that a valid locale name value is in the request.cookies dictionary under the key named _LOCALE_. This is usually the result of setting a _LOCALE_ cookie in a prior response, e.g. response.set_cookie('_LOCALE_', 'de').

# Locale Negotiators

	1) The Default Locale Negotiator

		Most applications can make use of the default locale negotiator, which requires no additional coding or configuration.

		The default locale negotiator implementation named default_locale_negotiator uses the following set of steps to dermine the locale name.

		* First, the negotiator looks for the _LOCALE_ attribute of the request object (possibly set directly by view code or by a listener for an event).
		* Then it looks for the request.params['_LOCALE_'] value.
		* Then it looks for the request.cookies['_LOCALE_'] value.
		* If no locale can be found via the request, it falls back to using the default locale name (see Localization-Related Deployment Settings).
		* Finally, if the default locale name is not explicitly set, it uses the locale name en.

Virtual Hosting

	Pyramid supports a common form of virtual hosting whereby you can host a Pyramid application as a “subset” of some other site.
	(e.g. under http://example.com/mypyramidapplication/ as opposed to under http://example.com/).

	Skipped some.

	1. In "pure Python" env, maybe when app started by "paste server development.ini --reload" try this:
		[NOT VERIFIED SO FAR, SINCE I CAN IGNORE THIS FEATURE ON DEVELOPMENT PHASE]:

		[app:mypyramidapp]
		use = egg:mypyramidapp#app

		[composite:main]
		use = egg:Paste#urlmap
		/pyramidapp = mypyramidapp


	2. In Nginx + uWsgi:

	You can figure out this in /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf "location" entry.

	location /python {
		uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:3031;
		include uwsgi_params;
		# The two line below  will make sure application_url will be http://xxx/python
		# uwsgi_modifier1 30; will rewrite PATH_INFO value removing the SCRIPT_NAME from it.
		# In this way we will have correct application_url and url dispatch mapping.
		uwsgi_param SCRIPT_NAME /python;
		uwsgi_modifier1 30;
	}


Unit, Integration, and Functional Testing

	1) Unit testing is, not surprisingly, the act of testing a “unit” in your application. In this context, a “unit” is often a function or a method of a class instance. The unit is also referred to as a “unit under test”.

	2) An integration test, on the other hand, is a different form of testing in which the interaction between two or more “units” is explicitly tested. Integration tests verify that the components of your application work together. You might make sure that an email was actually sent in an integration test.

	3) A functional test is a form of integration test in which the application is run “literally”. You would have to make sure that an email was actually sent in a functional test, because it tests your code end to end.

# Test Set Up and Tear Down

	The use of the setUp() and tearDown() functions allows you to supply each unit test method in a test case with an environment that has an isolated registry and an isolated request for the duration of a single test. Here’s an example of using this feature:

	import unittest
	from pyramid import testing

	class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
		def setUp(self):
			self.config = testing.setUp()

		def tearDown(self):
			testing.tearDown()

	The above will make sure that get_current_registry() called within a test case method of MyTest will return the application registry associated with the config Configurator instance. Each test case method attached to MyTest will use an isolated registry.

	import unittest
	from pyramid import testing

	class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
		def setUp(self):
			request = testing.DummyRequest()
			self.config = testing.setUp(request=request)

		def tearDown(self):
			testing.tearDown()

	If you pass a request object into pyramid.testing.setUp() within your test case’s setUp, any test method attached to the MyTest test case that directly or indirectly calls get_current_request() will receive the request object. Otherwise, during testing, get_current_request() will return None. We use a “dummy” request implementation supplied by pyramid.testing.DummyRequest because it’s easier to construct than a “real” Pyramid request object.

# Using the Configurator and pyramid.testing APIs in Unit Tests

	The Configurator API and the pyramid.testing module provide a number of functions which can be used during unit testing.

	For example, let’s imagine you want to unit test a Pyramid view function.

	from pyramid.security import has_permission
	from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPForbidden

	def view_fn(request):
		if not has_permission('edit', request.context, request):
			raise HTTPForbidden
		return {'greeting':'hello'}

	Without doing anything special during a unit test, the call to has_permission() in this view function will always return a True value.
	So how do you test the branch of the code in this view function that raises Forbidden?

	The testing API provided by Pyramid allows you to simulate various application registry registrations for use under a unit testing framework without needing to invoke the actual application configuration implied by its main function.

	import unittest
	from pyramid import testing

	class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
		def setUp(self):
			self.config = testing.setUp()

		def tearDown(self):
			testing.tearDown()

		def test_view_fn_forbidden(self):
			from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPForbidden
			from my.package import view_fn
			self.config.testing_securitypolicy(userid='hank',
											   permissive=False)
			request = testing.DummyRequest()
			request.context = testing.DummyResource()
			self.assertRaises(HTTPForbidden, view_fn, request)

		def test_view_fn_allowed(self):
			from my.package import view_fn
			self.config.testing_securitypolicy(userid='hank',
											   permissive=True)
			request = testing.DummyRequest()
			request.context = testing.DummyResource()
			response = view_fn(request)
			self.assertEqual(response, {'greeting':'hello'})

	See the pyramid.testing(http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/api/testing.html#testing-module) chapter for the entire Pyramid -specific testing API.
	This chapter describes APIs for registering a security policy, registering resources at paths, registering event listeners, registering views and view permissions, and classes representing “dummy” implementations of a request and a resource.

	See also the various methods of the Configurator documented in pyramid.config(http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/api/config.html#configuration-module) that begin with the testing_ prefix.

# Creating Integration Tests(Optional Tests)

	Let’s demonstrate this by showing an integration test for a view. The below test assumes that your application’s package name is myapp, and that there is a views module in the app with a function with the name my_view in it that returns the response ‘Welcome to this application’ after accessing some values that require a fully set up environment.

	import unittest

	from pyramid import testing

	class ViewIntegrationTests(unittest.TestCase):
		def setUp(self):
			""" This sets up the application registry with the
			registrations your application declares in its ``includeme``
			function.
			"""
			import myapp
			self.config = testing.setUp()
			self.config.include('myapp')

		def tearDown(self):
			""" Clear out the application registry """
			testing.tearDown()

		def test_my_view(self):
			from myapp.views import my_view
			request = testing.DummyRequest()
			result = my_view(request)
			self.assertEqual(result.status, '200 OK')
			body = result.app_iter[0]
			self.failUnless('Welcome to' in body)
			self.assertEqual(len(result.headerlist), 2)
			self.assertEqual(result.headerlist[0],
							 ('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'))
			self.assertEqual(result.headerlist[1], ('Content-Length',
													str(len(body))))

	Unless you cannot avoid it, you should prefer writing unit tests that use the Configurator API to set up the right “mock” registrations rather than creating an integration test. Unit tests will run faster (because they do less for each test) and the result of a unit test is usually easier to make assertions about.

# Creating Functional Tests

	The below test assumes that your application’s package name is myapp, and that there is a view that returns an HTML body when the root URL is invoked. It further assumes that you’ve added a tests_require dependency on the WebTest package within your setup.py file. WebTest is a functional testing package written by Ian Bicking.

	import unittest

	class FunctionalTests(unittest.TestCase):
		def setUp(self):
			from myapp import main
			app = main({})
			from webtest import TestApp
			self.testapp = TestApp(app)

		def test_root(self):
			res = self.testapp.get('/', status=200)
			self.failUnless('Pyramid' in res.body)

	See the WebTest documentation(http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/en/latest/index.html) for further information about the methods available to a webtest.TestApp instance.

Security

# Enabling an Authorization Policy

	By default it's disabled.

# Enabling an Authorization Policy Imperatively

	Since authorization, in general, depends upon authentication, you must enable both them.

	1 from pyramid.config import Configurator
	2 from pyramid.authentication import AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy
	3 from pyramid.authorization import ACLAuthorizationPolicy
	4 authentication_policy = AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy('seekrit')
	5 authorization_policy = ACLAuthorizationPolicy()
	6 config = Configurator()
	7 config.set_authentication_policy(authentication_policy)
	8 config.set_authorization_policy(authorization_policy)

# Protecting Views with Permissions

	1 # config is an instance of pyramid.config.Configurator
	2
	3 config.add_view('mypackage.views.blog_entry_add_view',
	4                 name='add_entry.html',
	5                 context='mypackage.resources.Blog',
	6                 permission='add')

	The equivalent view registration including the add permission name may be performed via the @view_config decorator:

	1 from pyramid.view import view_config
	2 from resources import Blog
	3
	4 @view_config(context=Blog, name='add_entry.html', permission='add')
	5 def blog_entry_add_view(request):
	6     """ Add blog entry code goes here """
	7     pass

		As a result of any of these various view configuration statements, the requesting user will need to possess the add permission against the context resource in order to be able to invoke the blog_entry_add_view view. If he does not, the Forbidden view will be invoked.

# Setting a Default Permission

	If a permission is not supplied to a view configuration, the registered view will always be executable by entirely anonymous users: any authorization policy in effect is ignored.
	In support of making it easier to configure applications which are “secure by default”, Pyramid allows you to configure a default permission.

	The pyramid.config.Configurator.set_default_permission() method supports configuring a default permission for an application.

	When a default permission is registered:

    • if a view configuration names an explicit permission, the default permission is ignored for that view registration, and the view-configuration-named permission is used.
	• if a view configuration names the permission pyramid.security.NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED, the default permission is ignored, and the view is registered without a permission(making it available to all callers regardless of their credentials).

	Warning

	When you register a default permission, all views (even exception view views) are protected by a permission. For all views which are truly meant to be anonymously accessible, you will need to associate the view’s configuration with the pyramid.security.NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED permission.

# Assigning ACLs to your Resource Objects

	jiawzhang XXX: __acl__ here is resource objects based, which is mainly for "traverse" rather than "url dispatch" way, how do I leverage acl stuffs in "url dispatch", goole the answser maybe.
	Check out the "SQLAlchemy + URL Dispatch Wiki Tutorial" above, in that case, it explains how to do the same thing in url dispatch based app.

	For example, an ACL might be attached to the resource for a blog via its class:

	1 from pyramid.security import Everyone
	2 from pyramid.security import Allow
	3
	4 class Blog(object):
	5     __acl__ = [
	6         (Allow, Everyone, 'view'),
	7         (Allow, 'group:editors', 'add'),
	8         (Allow, 'group:editors', 'edit'),
	9         ]

	Or, if your resources are persistent, an ACL might be specified via the __acl__ attribute of an instance of a resource:

	1 from pyramid.security import Everyone
	2 from pyramid.security import Allow
	3
	4 class Blog(object):
	5     pass
	6
	7 blog = Blog()
	8
	9 blog.__acl__ = [
	10         (Allow, Everyone, 'view'),
	11         (Allow, 'group:editors', 'add'),
	12         (Allow, 'group:editors', 'edit'),
	13         ]

# Elements of an ACL

	1 from pyramid.security import Everyone
	2 from pyramid.security import Allow
	3 from pyramid.security import Deny
	4
	5 __acl__ = [
	6     (Allow, Everyone, 'view'),
	7     (Deny, Everyone, 'view'),
	8     ]

	The default authorization policy will allow everyone the view permission, even though later in the ACL you have an ACE that denies everyone the view permission.

	1 from pyramid.security import Everyone
	2 from pyramid.security import Allow
	3
	4 __acl__ = [
	5     (Allow, Everyone, 'view'),
	6     (Allow, 'group:editors', ('add', 'edit')),
	7     ]

	The acl can be collapsed as above.

# Special Principal Names

	pyramid.security.Everyone

	See the sample above.

	pyramid.security.Authenticated

	Any user with credentials as determined by the current security policy. You might think of it as any user that is “logged in”.

# Special Permissions

	pyramid.security.ALL_PERMISSIONS

	An object representing, literally, all permissions. Useful in an ACL like so: (Allow, 'fred', ALL_PERMISSIONS). Has the effect of indicating that a given principal “has” any permission asked for by the system.

# Special ACEs

	A convenience ACE is defined representing a deny to everyone of all permissions in pyramid.security.DENY_ALL. This ACE is often used as the last ACE of an ACL to explicitly cause inheriting authorization policies to “stop looking up the traversal tree” (effectively breaking any inheritance). For example, an ACL which allows only fred the view permission for a particular resource despite what inherited ACLs may say when the default authorization policy is in effect might look like so:

	1 from pyramid.security import Allow
	2 from pyramid.security import DENY_ALL
	3
	4 __acl__ = [ (Allow, 'fred', 'view'), DENY_ALL ]

	“Under the hood”, the pyramid.security.DENY_ALL ACE equals the following:

	1 from pyramid.security import ALL_PERMISSIONS
	2 __acl__ = [ (Deny, Everyone, ALL_PERMISSIONS) ]

# ACL Inheritance and Location-Awareness

	While the default authorization policy is in place, if a resource object does not have an ACL when it is the context, its parent is consulted for an ACL. If that object does not have an ACL, its parent is consulted for an ACL, ad infinitum, until we’ve reached the root and there are no more parents left.

	In order to allow the security machinery to perform ACL inheritance, resource objects must provide location-awareness. Providing location-awareness means two things: the root object in the resource tree must have a _name__ attribute and a __parent__ attribute.

	1 class Blog(object):
	2     __name__ = ''
	3     __parent__ = None

	An object with a __parent__ attribute and a __name__ attribute is said to be location-aware. Location-aware objects define an __parent__ attribute which points at their parent object. The root object’s __parent__ is None.

	Check out "Using Hooks" -> '# Changing the Forbidden View'

# Debugging View Authorization Failures

	1 [app:main]
	2 use = egg:MyProject
	3 debug_authorization = true

	With this debug flag turned on, the response sent to the browser will also contain security debugging information in its body.

# Debugging Imperative Authorization Failures

	The pyramid.security.has_permission() API is used to check security within view functions imperatively. It returns instances of objects that are effectively booleans. But these objects are not raw True or False objects, and have information attached to them about why the permission was allowed or denied. The object will be one of pyramid.security.ACLAllowed, pyramid.security.ACLDenied, pyramid.security.Allowed, or pyramid.security.Denied, as documented in pyramid.security. At the very minimum these objects will have a msg attribute, which is a string indicating why the permission was denied or allowed. Introspecting this information in the debugger or via print statements when a call to has_permission() fails is often useful.

Using Hooks

“Hooks” can be used to influence the behavior of the Pyramid framework in various ways.

# Changing the Not Found View

	1) Imperative configuration

		from helloworld.views import notfound
		config.add_notfound_view(notfound)

	   Replace helloworld.views.notfound_view with a reference to the view callable you want to use to represent the Not Found view.

	2) Decorator which is equivalent to 1) above

		from pyramid.view import notfound_view_config

		@notfound_view_config()
		def notfound(request):
			return Response('Not Found, dude', status='404 Not Found')

		def main(globals, **settings):
		   config = Configurator()
		   config.scan()

	3) Multiple not found views
	Both pyramid.config.Configurator.add_notfound_view() and pyramid.view.notfound_view_config take most of the same arguments as pyramid.config.Configurator.add_view and pyramid.view.view_config, respectively. This means that not found views can carry predicates limiting their applicability:

		from pyramid.view import notfound_view_config

		@notfound_view_config(request_method='GET')
		def notfound_get(request):
			return Response('Not Found during GET, dude', status='404 Not Found')

		@notfound_view_config(request_method='POST')
		def notfound_post(request):
			return Response('Not Found during POST, dude', status='404 Not Found')

		def main(globals, **settings):
		   config = Configurator()
		   config.scan()

	Like any other view, the notfound view must accept at least a request parameter, or both context and request. The request is the current request representing the denied action. The context (if used in the call signature) will be the instance of the HTTPNotFound exception that caused the view to be called.

	Here’s some sample code that implements a minimal NotFound view callable:

	from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPNotFound

	def notfound(request):
		return HTTPNotFound()

	In the NotFound view callable cases above, the request.exception will be an instance of the HTTPNotFound exception caused the view to be called.
	The request.exception.message will be a value explaining why the not found error was raised.
	This message will be different when the pyramid.debug_notfound environment setting is true than it is when it is false.
	While request.context will be the instance of the HTTPNotFound exception that caused the view to be called.

# Changing the Forbidden View

	1) Imperative configuration

	from helloworld.views import forbidden_view
	from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPForbidden
	config.add_forbidden_view(forbidden_view)

	2) Decorator which is equivalent to 1) above

	from pyramid.view import forbidden_view_config

	@forbidden_view_config()
	def forbidden(request):
		return Response('forbidden')

	def main(globals, **settings):
	   config = Configurator()
	   config.scan()

	Here’s some sample code that implements a minimal forbidden view:

	from pyramid.views import view_config
	from pyramid.response import Response

	def forbidden_view(request):
		return Response('forbidden')

	In the Forbidden view callable cases above, the request.exception will be an instance of the HTTPForbidden exception caused the view to be called.
	The request.exception.message will be a value explaining why the forbidden was raised.
	request.exception.result will be extended information about the forbidden exception.
	These messages will be different when the pyramid.debug_authorization environment setting is true than it is when it is false.
	While request.context is the context found by the router when the view invocation was denied.

# Changing the Request Factory

	from pyramid.request import Request

	class MyRequest(Request):
		pass

	config = Configurator(request_factory=MyRequest)

	OR, you can do he following for the same purpose.

	from pyramid.config import Configurator
	from pyramid.request import Request

	class MyRequest(Request):
		pass

	config = Configurator()
	config.set_request_factory(MyRequest)

# Using The Before Render Event

	This is another way to add render global values.

	from pyramid.events import subscriber
	from pyramid.events import BeforeRender

	@subscriber(BeforeRender)
	def add_global(event):
		event['mykey'] = 'foo'

	An object of this type is sent as an event just before a renderer is invoked (but after the application-level renderer globals factory added via set_renderer_globals_factory, if any, has injected its own keys into the renderer globals dictionary).

	If a subscriber attempts to add a key that already exist in the renderer globals dictionary, a KeyError is raised. This limitation is enforced because event subscribers do not possess any relative ordering. The set of keys added to the renderer globals dictionary by all pyramid.events.BeforeRender subscribers and renderer globals factories must be unique.

	You can also access dictionary returned by view callable like this:

	Suppose you return {'mykey': 'somevalue', 'mykey2': 'somevalue2'} from your view callable, like so:

	from pyramid.view import view_config

	@view_config(renderer='some_renderer')
	def myview(request):
		return {'mykey': 'somevalue', 'mykey2': 'somevalue2'}

	rendering_val can be used to access these values from the BeforeRender object:

	from pyramid.events import subscriber
	from pyramid.events import BeforeRender

	@subscriber(BeforeRender)
	def read_return(event):
		# {'mykey': 'somevalue'} is returned from the view
		print(event.rendering_val['mykey'])


# Using Response Callbacks

	Adding a response callback allows an application to register an action to be performed against a response object once it is created, usually in order to mutate it.

	def cache_callback(request, response):
		"""Set the cache_control max_age for the response"""
		if request.exception is not None:
			response.cache_control.max_age = 360
	request.add_response_callback(cache_callback)

	Response callbacks are, however, invoked when an exception view is rendered successfully: in such a case, the request.exception attribute of the request when it enters a response callback will be an exception object instead of its default value of None.

	Response callbacks are called in the order they’re added (first-to-most-recently-added). All response callbacks are called after the NewResponse event is sent. Errors raised by response callbacks are not handled specially. They will be propagated to the caller of the Pyramid router application.

	A response callback has a lifetime of a single request. If you want a response callback to happen as the result of every request, you must re-register the callback into every new request (perhaps within a subscriber of a NewRequest event).

# Using Finished Callbacks

	A finished callback is a function that will be called unconditionally by the Pyramid router at the very end of request processing. A finished callback can be used to perform an action at the end of a request unconditionally.

	import transaction

	def commit_callback(request):
		'''commit or abort the transaction associated with request'''
		if request.exception is not None:
			transaction.abort()
		else:
			transaction.commit()
	request.add_finished_callback(commit_callback)

	Finished callbacks are called in the order they’re added (first-to-most-recently-added). Finished callbacks (unlike a response callback) are always called, even if an exception happens in application code that prevents a response from being generated.
	As a result, mutations performed to the request provided to a finished callback will have no meaningful effect, because response processing will have already occurred, and the request’s scope will expire almost immediately after all finished callbacks have been processed.

	It is often necessary to tell whether an exception occurred within view callable code from within a finished callback: in such a case, the request.exception attribute of the request when it enters a response callback will be an exception object instead of its default value of None.

	Errors raised by finished callbacks are not handled specially. They will be propagated to the caller of the Pyramid router application.

	A finished callback has a lifetime of a single request. If you want a finished callback to happen as the result of every request, you must re-register the callback into every new request (perhaps within a subscriber of a NewRequest event).

# Changing How Pyramid Treats View Responses

	Like what we are told before, view callables can only return pyramid.response.Response object or an non-Response object but with a renderer accompanies, otherwise, the router will raise an error.
	If you’d like to allow view callables to return bare string objects (without requiring a a renderer to convert a string to a response object), you can register an adapter which converts the string to a Response:

	from pyramid.response import Response

	def string_response_adapter(s):
		response = Response(s)
		return response

	# config is an instance of pyramid.config.Configurator

	config.add_response_adapter(string_response_adapter, str)

	Likewise, if you want to be able to return a simplified kind of response object from view callables, you can use the IResponse hook to register an adapter to the more complex IResponse interface:

	from pyramid.response import Response

	class SimpleResponse(object):
		def __init__(self, body):
			self.body = body

	def simple_response_adapter(simple_response):
		response = Response(simple_response.body)
		return response

	# config is an instance of pyramid.config.Configurator

	config.add_response_adapter(simple_response_adapter, SimpleResponse)

	Instead of using pyramid.config.Configurator.add_response_adapter(), you can use the pyramid.response.response_adapter decorator:

	from pyramid.response import Response
	from pyramid.response import response_adapter

	@response_adapter(str)
	def string_response_adapter(s):
		response = Response(s)
		return response
	
	The response_adapter decorator will have no effect until activated by a scan.

	If you want to implement your own Response object instead of using the pyramid.response.Response object in any capacity at all, you’ll have to make sure the object implements every attribute and method outlined in pyramid.interfaces.IResponse and you’ll have to ensure that it uses zope.interface.implementer(IResponse) as a class decoratoror.

	from pyramid.interfaces import IResponse
	from zope.interface import implementer

	@implementer(IResponse)
	class MyResponse(object):
		# ... an implementation of every method and attribute
		# documented in IResponse should follow ...

	When an alternate response object implementation is returned by a view callable, if that object asserts that it implements IResponse (via zope.interface.implementer(IResponse)) , an adapter needn’t be registered for the object; Pyramid will use it directly.

# Using a View Mapper

	Skipped.

# Registering Configuration Decorators

	Decorators such as view_config don’t change the behavior of the functions or classes they’re decorating. Instead, when a scan is performed, a modified version of the function or class is registered with Pyramid.
	You may wish to have your own decorators that offer such behaviour. This is possible by using the Venusian package in the same way that it is used by Pyramid.

	Skipped.

# Registering "Tweens"

	Skipped for now.


Pyramid Configuration Introspection

# Using the Introspector

	Here’s an example of using Pyramid’s introspector from within a view callable:

	 from pyramid.view import view_config
	 from pyramid.response import Response

	 @view_config(route_name='bar')
	 def route_accepts(request):
		 introspector = request.registry.introspector
		 route_name = request.matched_route.name
		 route_intr = introspector.get('routes', route_name)
		 return Response(str(route_intr['pattern']))

	This view will return a response that contains the “pattern” argument provided to the add_route method of the route which matched when the view was called. It uses the pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospector.get() method to return an introspectable in the category routes with a discriminator equal to the matched route name. It then uses the returned introspectable to obtain a “pattern” value.

	The introspectable returned by the query methods of the introspector has methods and attributes described by pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospectable. In particular, the get(), get_category(), categories(), categorized(), and related() methods of an introspector can be used to query for introspectables.

# Introspectable Objects
	'route_intr' above is the introspectable object which implements the attributes and methods documented at pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospectable

	The important attributes shared by all introspectables are the following:
	title, category_name, discriminator, discriminator_hash, type_name, action_info

	check details at: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/narr/introspector.html

	Besides having the attributes described above, an introspectable is a dictionary-like object. An introspectable can be queried for data values via its __getitem__, get, keys, values, or items methods. For example:

	route_intr = introspector.get('routes', 'edit_user')
	pattern = route_intr['pattern']

# Pyramid Introspection Categories

Extending An Existing Pyramid Application

	Skipped.


Advanced Configuration

	It's basically talking about how to handle the conflict detection like below:

	################################################
	from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
	from pyramid.config import Configurator
	from pyramid.response import Response

	def hello_world(request):
		return Response('Hello world!')

	def goodbye_world(request):
		return Response('Goodbye world!')

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		config = Configurator()

		config.add_view(hello_world, name='hello')

		# conflicting view configuration
		config.add_view(goodbye_world, name='hello')

		app = config.make_wsgi_app()
		server = make_server('0.0.0.0', 8080, app)
		server.serve_forever()
	################################################

	This will cause the error like below:

	pyramid.exceptions.ConfigurationConflictError:
			Conflicting configuration actions
	  For: ('view', None, '', None, <InterfaceClass pyramid.interfaces.IView>,
			None, None, None, None, None, False, None, None, None)
	  Line 14 of file app.py in <module>: 'config.add_view(hello_world)'
	  Line 17 of file app.py in <module>: 'config.add_view(goodbye_world)'

	Skip the rest of this chapter, take a look if necessary.


Extending Pyramid Configuration

# Adding Methods to the Configurator via add_directive
	The add_directive() method accepts two positional arguments: a method name and a callable object. The callable object is usually a function that takes the configurator instance as its first argument and accepts other arbitrary positional and keyword arguments. For example:

	from pyramid.events import NewRequest
	from pyramid.config import Configurator

	def add_newrequest_subscriber(config, subscriber):
		config.add_subscriber(subscriber, NewRequest)

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		config = Configurator()
		config.add_directive('add_newrequest_subscriber',
							 add_newrequest_subscriber)

	Once add_directive() is called, a user can then call the added directive by its given name as if it were a built-in method of the Configurator:

	def mysubscriber(event):
		print event.request

	config.add_newrequest_subscriber(mysubscriber)

	Skip the rest of this chapter, take a look if necessary.


Creating Pyramid Scaffolds

	Skip for now.


Thread Locals

	When a request is processed, Pyramid makes two thread local variables available to the application: a “registry” and a “request”.

	Pyramid internals use two API functions to retrieve the request and application registry: get_current_request() and get_current_registry(). The former returns the “current” request; the latter returns the “current” registry. Both get_current_* functions retrieve an object from a thread-local data structure. These API functions are documented in pyramid.threadlocal.

	During normal operations, the thread locals stack is managed by a Router object. At the beginning of a request, the Router pushes the application’s registry and the request on to the stack. At the end of a request, the stack is popped. The topmost request and registry on the stack are considered “current”. Therefore, when the system is operating normally, the very definition of “current” is defined entirely by the behavior of a pyramid Router.

	However, during unit testing, no Router code is ever invoked, and the definition of “current” is defined by the boundary between calls to the pyramid.config.Configurator.begin() and pyramid.config.Configurator.end() methods (or between calls to the pyramid.testing.setUp() and pyramid.testing.tearDown() functions). These functions push and pop the threadlocal stack when the system is under test. See Test Set Up and Tear Down for the definitions of these functions.

# Why You Shouldn’t Abuse Thread Locals

	You probably should almost never use the get_current_request() or get_current_registry() functions, except perhaps in tests. In particular, it’s almost always a mistake to use get_current_request or get_current_registry in application code because its usage makes it possible to write code that can be neither easily tested nor scripted.


Using the Zope Component Architecture in Pyramid

	Accordingly, Pyramid tends to hide the presence of the ZCA from application developers. You needn’t understand the ZCA to create a Pyramid application; its use is effectively only a framework implementation detail.

	Thus, Skip this chapter.

// it will also prevent main thread go ahead. We suggest in non-ui thread, just copy shared parameter value in
// critical section.

Just preface any variable that needs to be different for each thread with __declspec (thread), like so 

__declspec (thread) int iGlobal = 1 ;

for static variables external to any function, or like so 

__declspec (thread) static int iLocal = 2 ;

for static variables within functions.

    real Bourne shell although it did run under Bash in Bourne shell mode.

    * src/create_symbols_file.py
    Rewrite of above in Python. Also add support for writing Win32 .def files.
    The Python script generates Symbols.linux, Symbols.darwin and
    libsndfile.def (Win32 version). These files get shipped with the tarball
    so there should not be necessary to run the Python script when building
    the code from the tarball.

    Make sure config.h is included before stdio.h to make sure large file
    support is enabled on Linux (and Solaris).

    * tests/misc_test.c
    Disable update_header test on Win32. This should work but doesn't and
    I'm not sure why.

    * Make.bat Win32/Makefile.msvc
    Updates.

2004-01-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

2003-12-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * doc/FAQ.html
    Minor mods to pkg-config section.

2003-12-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/create_symbols_file.sh
    Andre Pang (also known as Ozone) pointed out that on MacOSX, all non
    static symbols are exported causing troubles when trying to link
    libsndfile with another library which has any of the same symbols.
    He fixed this by supplying the MacOSX linker with a file containing
    all the public symbols so that only they would be exported and then
    supplied a patch for libsndfile.
    This wasn't quite ideal, because I would have to maintain two (3 if
    you include Win32) separate files containing the exported symbols.
    A better solution was to create this script which can generate a
    Symbols file for Linux, MacoSX and any other OS that supports
    minimising the number of exported symbols.

    * configure.ac src/Makefile.am
    Hook the new script into the build process.

2003-12-10  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

2003-12-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/file_io.c
    Axel Roebel pointed out that on Mac OSX a pipe is not considered a fifo
    (S_ISFIFO (st.st_mode) is false) but a socket (S_ISSOCK (st.st_mode) is
    true). The test has therefore been changed to is S_ISREG and anything
    which which does not return true for S_ISREG is considered a pipe.

2003-11-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/file_io.c
    Ross Bencina has contributed code to replace all of the (mostly broken)
    Win32 POSIX emulation calls with calls the native Win32 file I/O API.
    This code still needs testing but is likely to be a huge improvemnt
    of support for Win32. Thanks Ross.

2003-10-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/dwvw.c

2003-10-26  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/gsm610.h
    Rename a variable from true to true_flag. As Ross Bencina points out,
    true is defined in the C99 header <stdbool.h>.

    * src/file_io.c
    If fstat() fails, return SF_TRUE instead of -1 (Ross Bencina).

2003-10-09  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.h
    Increase the size of SF_BUFFER_LEN and SF_HEADER_LEN.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed a potential bug where psf->sf.seekable was being set to FALSE when
    operating on stdin or stdout but then the default initialiser was reseting
    it to TRUE. Thanks to Axel Roebel.

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed a bug in the header parser where it was not handling an odd length
    COMM chunk correctly. Thanks to Axel Roebel.

    about ACIDized WAV files.

2003-04-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/file_io.c
    Fixed Win32 version of psf_fseek() which was calling psf_get_filelen()
    which was in turn calling psf_fseek() which in the end blew the stack.
    Now of course this would have been easy to find on Linux, but this blow
    up was happening in kernel32.dll and the fscking MSVC++ debugger couldn't
    figure out what call caused this (it couldn't even tell me the stack had
    overflowed) and was absolutley useless for this debugging exercise.
    On top of that, the reason I got into this mess was that windoze doesn't
    have a working fstat() function which can return file lengths > 2 Gig. It
    HAS a fscking _fstati64() but the file length value is only updated AFTER
    the bloody file is closed. That makes it completely useless.
    How the hell do people stand working on this crap excuse of an OS?

2003-04-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * Win32/unistd.h src/file_io.c
    Moved definitions of S_IGRP etc from file_io.c to unistd.h so that these

    They still need to be tested.

2003-04-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/strings.c
    Found and fixed a bug which was causing psf_store_string() to fail on
    Motorola 68k processors. Many thanks fo Joshua Haberman (Debian maintainer
    of libsndfile) for compiling and running debug code to help me debug the
    problem.

2003-04-26  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c src/file_io.c src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Much hacking to get reading and writing of embedded files working (ie sound
    files at a non-zero files offset).

    * doc/embedded_files.html
    First pass atempt at documenting reading/writing embedded files.

2003-04-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

2003-04-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Fix retrieving and storing of string data from files. Need to be careful

2003-04-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/file_io.c
    Fix psf_fseek() for seeks withing embedded files.

2003-04-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.h.in
    Changed the definition of SNDFILE slightly to produce warnings when it isn't
    used correctly. This should have zero affect in code which uses the SNDFILE
    type correctly.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed a few compiler warnings cause by the changes to the SNDFILE type.

2003-04-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * doc/FAQ.html
    Added question and answer to the question "How about adding the ability
    to write/read sound files to/from memory buffers?".

2003-04-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/write_read_test.tpl
    Removed un-needed enums declaring TRUE and FALSE and replaced usage of
    these with SF_TRUE and SF_FALSE.

    * tests/multi_file_test.c
    New test program to test sf_open_fd() on files containing data other than
    a single sound file.

2003-04-06  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/file_io.c
    When creating files, set the readable by others flag. This still allows
    further restrictions to be enforced by use of the user's umask. Fix
    suggested by Eric Lyon.

2003-04-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.h.in src/sndfile.c
    Changed sf_open_fd(). Dropped offset parameter and added a close_desc
    parameter. If close desc is TRUE, the file descritpor passed into the
    library will be closed when sf_close() is called.

    * tests/utils.tpl
    Modified call to sf_open_fd() to set close_desc parameter to SF_TRUE.

2003-04-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/write_read_test.tpl
    Add a string (using sf_set_string() function) before and after data section
    of all files. This will make sure that if string data can be added, it
    doesn't overwrite real audio data.

2003-04-02  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Started work on supporting a non-zero offset parameter for sf_open_fd ().

    * src/<file header parsers>.c
    Removed many uses of psf_fseek (SEEK_END) which to allow for future use of
    sf_open_fd() with non-zero offset.
    Associated refactoring.

    * src/aiff.c
    Implemented functionality required to get sf_get_string() and
    sf_set_string() working for AIFF files.

    * tests/utils.tpl
    Modified test_open_file_or_die() to alternately use sf_open() and
    sf_open_fd().

    * src/svx.c
    Fixed a bug which occurred when openning an existing file for read/write
    using sf_open_fd(). In this case, the existing NAME chunk needs to be
    read into psf->filename.
    Fixed printing of sf_count_t types to logbuffer.

2003-03-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.h.in
    Added prototype for new function sf_open_fd().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Moved most of the code in sf_open() to a new function psf_open_file().
    Created new function sf_open_fd() which also uses psf_open_file() but
    does not currently support the offset parameter.

    * doc/api.html
    Document sf_open_fd().

2003-03-09  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed a memory leak reported by Evgeny Karpov. Memory leak only occurred
    when an attempt was made to read and the open() call fails.

2003-03-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/open_fail_test.c
    New test program to check for memory leaks when sf_open fails on a valid
    file. Currently this must be run manually under valgrid.

    * tests/Makefile.am
    Hook new test program into build.

    * examples/sndfile-play.c examples/sndfile-info.c
    When run on Win32 without any command line parameters print a message and
    then sleep for 5 seconds. This means the when somebody double clicks on
    these programs in explorer the user will actually see the message.

2003-01-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/misc_test.c
    Bypass permission test if running as root because root is allowed to open
    a readonly file for write.

    * src/pcm.c src/alaw.c src/ulaw.c src/float32.c src/double64.c
    Previously, attempts to read beyond the end of a file would set psf->error
    to SFE_SHORT_ERROR. This behaviour diverged from the behaviour of the POSIX
    read() call but has now been fixed.
    Attempts to read beyond the end of the file will return a short read count
    but will not longer set any error.

2002-12-09  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Add more sanity checking when opening a RAW file for read. When format is

    made to read beyond the end and then sf_seek() was called with a whence
    parameter of SEEK_CUR.

    * src/file_io.c
    Win32's _fstati64() does not work, it returns BS. Re-implemented
    psf_get_filelen() in terms of psf_fseek().

    * tests/write_read_test.tpl
    Add a test to detect above bug.

    * src/float_cast.h
    Modification to prevent compiler warnings on Mac OS X.

    * src/file_io.c

2002-11-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.ac
    Disable use of native lrint()/lrintf() on Mac OSX. These functions exist on
    Mac OSX 10.2 but not on 10.1. Forcing the use of the versions in
    src/float_cast.h means that a library compiled on 10.2 will still work on
    10.1.

2002-11-06  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in configure.ac
    Renamed configure.in to configure.ac as expected by later versions of
    autoconf.
    Slight hacking of configure.ac to work with version 2.54 of autoconf.
    Changed to using -dumpversion instead of --version for determining GCC
    version numer as suggested by Anand Kumria.

    * src/G72x/Makefile.am
    Slight hacking required for operation with automake 1.6.3.

2002-11-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.c
    In psf_binheader_readf() changed type parameter type "b" type from size_t
    to int to prevent errors on IA64 CPU where sizeof (size_t) != sizeof (int).
    Thanks to Enrique Robledo Arnuncio for debugging this.

2002-11-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * test/command_test.tpl
    Changed test value so test would pass on Solaris.

    * src/Version_script.in
    Modified version numbering so that later versions of 1.0.X can replace
    earlier versions without recompilation.

    * src/vox_adpcm.c
    Fixed bug causing short reads.

2002-11-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    Add test for IEEE replacement floats and doubles.

2002-11-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed a possible divide by zero error when read the 'smpl' chunk. Thanks to
    Serg Repalov for the example file.

    * tests/pcm_test.tpl
    Used sf_command (SFC_TEST_IEEE_FLOAT_REPLACE) to test IEEE replacement code.
    Clean up pcm_double_test().

    * src/float32.c src/double64.c
    Force use of IEEE replacement code using psf->ieee_replace is TRUE,
    Print message to log_buffer as well.
    Rename all broken_read_* and broken_write* functions to replace_read_* and
    replace_write_*.

    * tests/util.tpl
    Added string_in_log_buffer().

    * tests/pcm_test.tpl
    Use string_in_log_buffer() to ensure that IEEE replacement code has been
    used.

    * configure.in
    Removed --enable-force-broken-float option. IEEE replacement code is now
    always tested.

2002-10-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/double64.c
    Implement code for read/writing IEEE doubles on platforms where the native
    double format is not IEEE.

    * src/float32.c src/common.h
    Remove float32_read() and float32_write(). Replace with float32_le_read(),
    float32_be_read(), float32_le_write() and float32_be_write() to match stuff
    in src/double64.c.

    * src/common.c
    Fix all usage of float32_write().

    * src/sndfile.h.in
    Added SFC_TEST_IEEE_FLOAT_REPLACE command (testing only).

    * src/common.h
    Added SF_PRIVATE field ieee_replace.

    * src/sndfile.c
    In sf_command() set/reset psf->ieee_replace.

2002-10-26  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/pcm_test.tpl
    Fixed a problem when testing with --enable-force-broken-float. The test was
    generating a value of negative zero and the broken float code is not able
    to write negative zero. Removing the negative zero fixed the test.

2002-10-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/file_io.c
    Added fix for Cygwin (suggested by Maros Michalik).

    Removed functions psf_ferror() and psf_clearerr() which were redundant
    after above improvements.

    * src/aiff.c src/svx.c src/w64.c src/wav.c
    Removed all use of psf_ferror() and psf_clearerr().

2002-10-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/misc_test.c
    Add test which attempts to write to /dev/full (on Linux anyway) to check
    for correct handling of writing to a full filesystem.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Return correct error message if the header cannot be written because the
    filesystem is full.

    * tests/util.tpl
    Corrected printing of file mode in error reporting.

    * src/mat5.c
    Fixed a bug where a MAT5 file written by libsndfile could not be opened by
    Octave 2.1.36.

2002-10-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.h src/file_io.c

2002-08-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in
    Bumped version to 1.0.rc6.

    * src/*.c
    Modified scaling of normalised floats and doubles to integers. Until now
    this has been done by multiplying by 0x8000 for short output, 0x80000000
    for 32 bit ints and so on. Unfortunately this can cause an overflow and
    wrap around in the target value. All thes values have therefore been
    reduced to 0x7FFF, 0x7FFFFFFF and so on. The conversion from ints to
    normalised floats and doubles remains unchanged. This does mean that for
    repeated conversions normalised float -> pcm16 -> normalised float would
    result in a decrease in amplitude of 0x7FFF/0x8000 on every round trip.
    This is undesirable but less undesireable than the wrap around I am trying
    to avoid.

    * tests/floating_point_test.c
    Removed file hash checking because new float scaling procedure introduced
    above prevented the ability to crate a has on both x86 and PowerPC systems.

2002-08-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.c
    Modified psf_log_printf() to accept the %% conversion specifier to allow
    printing of a single '%'.

    * src/sds.c
    Read only of 16 bit samples is working. Need to build a test harness for
    this and other read only formats.

2002-08-10  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    Changed values of HAVE_LRINT and HAVE_LRINTF to force use of code in
    float_cash.h.

    * src/sndfile.h
    Changes the name of samples field of the SF_INFO to frames. The old name
    had caused too much confusion and it simply had to be changed. There will
    be at least one more pre-release.

    Fixed more documentation bugs.

2002-07-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.h src/common.h
    Moved some yet-to-be-implelmented values for SF_FORMAT_* from the public
    header file sndfile.h to the private header file common.h to avoid
    confusion about the actual capabilities of libsndfile.

2002-07-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/aiff.c src/wav.c
    Fixed file parsing for WAV and AIFF files containing non-audio data after
    the data chunk.

    * src/aiff.c src/sndfile.c
    Add support for GSM 6.10 encoded AIFF files.

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c tests/Makefile.am

    * src/*.c
    Fix compiler warnings.

2002-07-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/command_test.c
    For SFC_SET_NORM_* tests, change the file format from SF_FORMAT_WAV to
    SF_FORMAT_RAW.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added sf_command(SFC_TEST_ADD_TRAILING_DATA) to allow testing of reading
    from AIFF and WAV files with non-audio data after the audio chunk.

    * src/common.h
    Add test commands SFC_TEST_WAV_ADD_INFO_CHUNK and
    SFC_TEST_AIFF_ADD_INST_CHUNK. When these commands are working, they will be
    moved to src/sndfile.h

    * src/aiff.c src/wav.c
    Begin implementation of XXXX_command() hook for sf_command().

    * tests/write_read_test.tpl
    Added sf_command (SFC_TEST_ADD_TRAILING_DATA) to ensure above new code was
    working.

2002-07-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/update_header_test.c
    Allow read sample count == write sample count - 1 to fix problems with VOC
    files.

    * tests/write_read_test.tpl tests/pcm_test.tpl
    Fixed some problems in the test suite discovered by using Valgrind.

2002-07-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/utils.[ch] tests/*.c
    Renamed check_log_buffer() to check_log_buffer_or_die().

    * src/sndfile.c
    SFC_UPDATE_HEADER_NOW and SFC_SETUPDATE_HEADER_AUTO almost finished. Works
    for all file formats other than VOC.

2002-07-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.[ch] src/common.h
    Started adding functionality to allow the file header to be updated before
    the file is closed on files open for SFM_WRITE. This was requested by
    Maurizio Umberto Puxeddu who is using libsndfile for file I/O in iCSound.

    * tests/update_header_test.c
    New test program to test that the above functionality is working correctly.

    * tests/peak_chunk_test.c tests/floating_point_test.c
    Cleanups.

2002-07-10  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sfendian.[ch]
    Changed length count parameters for all endswap_XXX() functions from
    sf_count_t (which can be 64 bit even on 32 bit architectures) to int. These
    functions are only called frin inside the library, are always called with
    integer parameters and doing the actual calculation on 64 bit values is
    slow in comparision to doing it on ints.

    * examples/sndfile-play.c
    More playback hacking for Win32.

2002-07-09  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.c
    In psf_log_printf(), changed %D format conversion specifier to %M (marker) and
    added %D specifier for printing the sf_count_t type.

    * src/*.c
    Changed all usage of psf_log_printf() with %D format conversion specifiers
    to use %M conversion instead.

    * tests/pcm_test.tpl tests/pcm_test.def
    New files to autogen pcm_test.c.

    * src/pcm.c
    Fixed bug in scaling floats and doubles to 24 bit PCM and vice versa.

2002-07-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in
    Fix setup of $ac_cv_sys_largefile_CFLAGS so that sndfile.pc gets valid
    values for CFLAGS.

    * examples/sndfile-play.c
    Start adding playback support for Win32.

2002-07-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.c
    Worked to removed compiler warnings.
    Extensive refactoring.

    * src/common.[ch]
    Added function psf_memset() which works like the standard C function memset
    but takes and sf_count_t as the length parameter.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Replaced calls to memset(0 with calls to psf_memset() as required.

2002-07-06  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added "libsndfile : " to the start of all error messages. This was suggested
    by Conrad Parker author of Sweep ( http://sweep.sourceforge.net/ ).

    * src/sfendian.[ch]
    Added endswap_XXXX_copy() functions.

    * src/pcm.c src/float32.c src/double64.c
    Use endswap_XXXX_copy() functions and removed dead code.
    Cleanups and optimisations.

2002-07-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h
    Gave values to all the SFC_* enum values to allow better control of the
    interface as commands are added and removed.
    Added new command SFC_SET_ADD_PEAK_CHUNK.

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Modified wav_write_header and aiff_write_header to make addition of a PEAK
    chunk optional, even on floating point files.

    * tests/benchmark.tpl
    Added call to sf_command(SFC_SET_ADD_PEAK_CHUNK) to turn off addition of a
    PEAK chunk for the benchmark where we are trying to miximize speed.

    * src.pcm.c
    Changed tribyte typedef to something more sensible.
    Further conversion speed ups.

2002-07-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/command.c
    In major_formats rename "Sphere NIST" to "NIST Sphere".

    * src/common.c src/sfendian.c
    Moved all endswap_XXX_array() functions to sfendian.c. These functions will
    be tweaked to provide maximum performance. Since maximum performance on one
    platform does not guarantee maximum performance on another, a small set of
    functions will be written and the optimal one chosen at compile time.

    * src/common.h src/sfendian.h
    Declarations of all endswap_XXX_array() functions moved to sfendian.h.

    * src/Makefile.am
    Add sfendian.c to build targets.

2002-07-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/pcm.c src/sfendian.h
    Re-coded PCM encoders and decoders to match or better the speed of
    libsndfile version 0.0.28.

2002-06-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c
    Add checking for WAVPACK data in standard PCM WAV file. Return error if
    found. This WAVPACK is *WAY* broken. It uses the same PCM WAV file header
    and then stores non-PCM data.

    * tests/benchmark.tpl
    Added more tests.

2002-06-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/benchmark.tpl
    Added conditional definition of M_PI.
    For Win32, set WRITE_PERMS to 0777.

    * Win32/Makefile.msvc
    Added target to make generate program on Win32.

    * src/samplitude.c
    Removed handler for Samplitude RAP file format. This file type seems rarer
    than hens teeth and is completely undocumented.

    * src/common.h src/sndfile.c src/Makefile.am Win32/Makefile.msvc
    Removed references to sampltiude RAP format.

    * tests/benchmark.tpl
    Benchmark program now prints the libsndfile version number when run. This
    program was also backported to version 0 to compare results. Version
    1.0.0rc2 is faster than version 0.0.28 on most conversions but slower on
    some. The slow ones need to be fixed before final release.

2002-06-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/benchmark.def tests/benchmark.tpl
    New files which generate tests/benchmark.c using Autogen. Added int ->
    SF_FORMAT_PCM_24 test.

    * tests/benchmark.c
    Now and Autogen output file.

    * tests/Makefile.am
    Updated for above changes.

2002-06-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/benchmark.c
    Basic benchmark program complete. Need to convert it to Autogen.

    * Win32/Makefile.msvc
    Added benchmark.exe target.

2002-06-26  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * examples/generate.c
    New program to generate a number of different output file formats from a
    single input file. This allows testing of the created files.

    * tests/benchmark.c
    New test program to benchmark libsndfile. Nowhere near complete yet.

    * examples/Makefile.am tests/Makefile.am
    New make rules for the two new programs.

2002-06-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * Win32/libsndfile.def
    Removed definition for sf_signal_max().

    Removed the header file as it was no longer being used. Thanks to Anand
    Kunria for spotting this.

    * doc/index.html
    A number of documentation bugs were fixed. Thanks to Anand Kumria.

2002-06-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.h
    Test for Win32 before testing SIZEOF_OFF_T so that it works correctly
    on Win32..

    * src/file_io.c
    Win32 fixes to ensure O_BINARY is used for file open.

    * doc/win32.html
    New file documenting the building libsndfile on Win32.

    * doc/*.html
    Updating of documentation.

2002-06-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/pcm_test.c
    Minor changes to allow easier determination of test file name.

    * src/sndfile.[ch]
    Removed function sf_signal_max().

    * examples/sndfile-play.c
    Changed call to sf_signal_max() to a call to sf_command().

2002-06-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/format.c src/command.c
    Renamed format.c to command.c which will now include code for sf_command()
    calls to perform operations other than format commands.

    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h
    Removed function sf_get_signal_max() which is replaced by commands passed
    to sf_command().

    * src/command.c
    Implement commands SFC_CALC_SIGNAL_MAX.

    * doc/command.html
    Documented SFC_CALC_SIGNAL_MAX.

2002-06-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * examples/sndfile-play.c
    Mods to make sndfile-play work on Solaris. The program sndfile-play now
    runs on Linux, MaxOSX and Solaris. Win32 to come.

    * src/format.c
    Added SF_FORMAT_DWVW_* to subtype_formats array.

    * src/nist.c
    Added support for 8 bit NIST Sphere files. Example file supplied by Anand
    Kumria.

2002-06-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * examples/sndfile-info.c
    Tidy up of output format.

    * examnples/sndfile-play.c
    Mods to make sndfile-play work on MacOSX using Apple's CoreAudio API.

    * configure.in
    Add new variables OS_SPECIFIC_INCLUDES and OS_SPECIFIC_LINKS which were
    required to supply extra include paths and link parameters to get
    sndfile-play working on MacOSX.

    * examples/Makefile.am
    Use OS_SPOECIFIC_INCLUDES and OS_SPECIFIC_LINKS to build commands for
    sndfile-play.

2002-06-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/nist.c
    Added ability to read/write new NIST Sphere file types (A-law, u-law).
    Header parser was re-written from scratch. Example files supplied by Anand
    Kumria.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Support for A-law and u-law NIST files.

    * tests/Makefile.am tests/lossy_comp_test.c

2002-06-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/utils.c
    Fixed an error in error string.

2002-06-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * acinclude.m4
    Removed exit command to allow cross-compiling.

    * Win32/unistd.h src/file_io.c
    Moved contents of first file into the second file (enclosed in #ifdef).
    Win32/unistd.h is now an empty file but still must be there for libsndfile
    to compile on Win32.

    * src/sd2.c, src/sndfile.c:
    Fixes for Sound Designer II files on big endian systems.

2002-06-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in
    Modified to work around problems with crappy MacOSX version of sed.
    Added sanity check for proper values for CFLAGS.

2002-06-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Code clean up in sf_open ().

    * Win32/Makefile.msvc
    Michael Fink's contributed MSVC++ makefile was hacked to bits and put back
    together in a new improved form.

    * src/file_io.c
    Fixes for Win32; _lseeki64() returns an invalid argument for calls like
    _lseeki64(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR) so need to use _telli64 (fd) instead.

    * src/common.h src/sndfile.c src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added SFE_LOG_OVERRUN error.
    Added termination for potential infinite loop when parsing file headers.

    * src/wav.c src/w64.c
    Fixed bug casuing incorrect header generation when opening file read/write.

2002-06-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * doc/api.html
    Improved the documentation to make it clearer that the file read method
    and the underlying file format are completely disconnected. Suggested
    by Josh Green.

    * doc/command.html
    Started correcting docs to take into account changes made to the
    operations of the sf_command () function. Not complete yet.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Reverted some changes which had broken the partially working SDII header
    parsing. Now have access to an iBook with OS X so reading and writing SDII
    files on all platforms should be a reality in the near future. On Mac this
    will involve reading the resource fork via the standard MacOS API. To move
    a file from Mac to another OS, the resource and data forks will need to be
    combined before transfer. The combined file will be read on both Mac and
    other OSes like any other file.

2002-06-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * ltmain.sh
    Applied a patch from http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/porting/libtool.php
    which allows libsndfile to compile on MacOSX 10.1. This patch should not
    interfere with compiling on other OSes.

    * src/GSM610/private.h
    Changes to fix compile problems on MacOSX (see src/GSM610/ChangeLog).

    * src/float_cast.h
    Added MacOSX replacements for lrint() and lrintf().

2002-06-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Replaced the code to print the filename to the log buffer when a file is
    opened. This code seems to have been left out during the merge of
    sf_open_read() and sf_open_write() to make a single  functions sf_open().

2002-06-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed a bug where the WAV header parser was going into an infinite loop
    on a badly formed LIST chunk. File supplied by David Viens.

2002-05-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in
    Added a message at the end of the configuration process to warn about the
    need for the use of pkg-config when linking programs against version 1 of
    libsndfile.

    * doc/pkg-config.html
    New documentation file containing details of how to use pkg-config to
    retrieve settings for CFLAGS and library locations for linking files
    against version 1 of libsndfile.

2002-05-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed minor bug in handling of so-called ACIDized WAV files.

2002-05-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * Win32/libsndfile.def Win32/Makefile.msvc
    Two new files contributed by Michael Fink (from the winLAME project)
    which allows libsndfile to be built on windows in a MSDOS box by doing
    "nmake -f Makefile.msvc". Way cool!

2002-05-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in
    MacOSX is SSSOOOOOOO screwed up!!! I can't believe how hard it is to
    generate a tarball which will configure and compile on that platform.
    Joined the libtool mailing list to try and get some answers.

2002-05-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in
    Changed to autoconf version 2.50. MacOSX uses autoconf version 2.53 which
    is incompatible with with version 2.13 which had been using until now.
    The AC_SYS_LARGE_FILE macro distributed withe autoconf 2.50 is missing a
    few features so AC_SYS_EXTRA_LARGE file was defined to replace it.

    * configure.in
    Changed to automake version 1.5 to try and make a tarball which will
    work on MacOSX.

2002-05-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav_gsm610.c
    Changed name to gsm610.c. Added reading/writing of headerless files.

    * src/sndfile.c src/raw.c
    Added ability to read/write headerless (SF_FORMAT_RAW) GSM 6.10 files.

2002-05-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Clean up in preparation for Autogen-ing this file.

    * src/GSM610/*.[ch]
    Code cleanup and prepartion forgetting file seek working. Details in
    src/GSM610/ChangeLog.

    * sndfile.pc.in
    Testing complete. Is sndfile.m4 still needed?

2002-05-09  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/write_read_test.tpl tests/rdwr_test.tpl
    Merged tests from these two programs into write_read_test.tpl and deleted
    rdwr_test.tpl.

2002-05-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/w64.c src/svx.c src/paf.c
    Fixed bugs in read/write mode.

2002-05-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * examples/Makefile.am
    Renamed sfplay.c to sndfile-play.c and sndfile_info.c to sndfile-info.c for
    consistency when these programs become part of the Debian package
    sndfile-programs.

    * sndfile.pc.in
    New file to replace sndfile-config.in. Libsndfile now uses the pkg-config
    model for providing installation parameters to dependant programs.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Cleanup of code in sf_open().

2002-05-06  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/utils.tpl tests/write_read_test.tpl
    More conversion to Autogen fixes and enchancements.

    * src/*.c
    Read/write mode is now working for 16, 24 and 32 bit PCM as well as 32
    bit float and 64 bit double data. More tests still required.

    * src/Makefile.am
    Added DISTCLEANFILES target to remove config.status and config.last.

    * Win32/Makefile.am MacOS/Makefile.am
    Added DISTCLEANFILES target to remove Makefile.

2002-05-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.[ch] tests/rdwr_test.c
    More verifying workings of read/write mode. Fixing bugs found.

    * tests/utils.[ch]
    Made these files Autogen generated files.

    * tests/util.tpl tests/util.def
    New Autogen files to generate utils.[ch]. Moved some generic test functions
    into this file. Autogen is such a great tool!

2002-05-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/pcm.c src/float_cast.h Win32/config.h
    Fixed a couple of Win32 specific bugs pointed out by Michael Fink
    (maintainer of WinLAME) and David Viens.

    * tests/check_log_buffer.[ch] tests/utils.[ch]
    Moved check_log_buffer() to utils.[ch] and deleted old file.

2002-05-02  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.[ch] src/sndfile.c
    New function psf_default_seek() which will be the default seek function
    for things like PCM and floating point data. This default is set for
    both read and write in sf_open() but can be over-ridden by any codec
    during it's initialisation.

2002-05-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/au.c
    AU files use a data size value of -1 to mean unknown. Fixed au_open_read()
    to allow opening files like this.

    * tests/rdwr_test .c
    Added more tests.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed bugs in read/write mode found due to improvements in the test
    program.

2002-04-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/rdwr_test .c
    New file for testing read/write mode.

2002-04-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * m4/*
    Removed all m4 macros from this directory as they get concatenated to form
    the file aclocal.m4 anyway.

    * sndfile.m4
    Moved this from the m4 directory to the root directory asn this is part of
    the distribution and is installed during "make install".

2002-04-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/float32.c
    Removed logging of peaks for all file formats other than AIFF and WAV.

    * tests/write_read_test.tpl tests/write_read_test.def
    New files which autogen uses to generate write_read_test.c. Doing it this
    way makes write_read_test.c far easier to maintain. Other test programs
    will be converted to autogen in the near future.

    * src/*.c
    Fixed a few bugs found when testing on Sparc (bug endian) Solaris.

2002-04-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * doc/*.html
    Fixed documention versioning.

    * configure.in
    Fixed a bug in the routines which search for Large File Support on systems
    which have large file support by defualt.

2002-04-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.[ch]
    Found and fixed an issue which can cause a bug in other software (I was
    porting Conrad Parker's Sweep program from version 0 of the library to
    version 1). When opening a file for write, the libsndfile code would
    set the sfinfo.samples field to a maximum value.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests to detect the above problem.

2002-04-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.[ch]
    Finished base implementation of read/write mode. Much more testing still
    needed.

    * m4/largefile.m4
    Macro for detecting Large File Standard capabilities. This macro was ripped
    out of the aclocal.m4 file of GNU tar-1.13.

    * configure.in
    Added detection of large file support. Files larger than 2 Gigabytes should
    now be supported on 64 bit platforms and many 32 bit platforms including
    Linux (2.4 kernel, glibc-2.2), *BSD, MacOS, Win32.

    * libsndfile_convert_version.py
    A Python script which attempts to autoconvert code written to use version 0
    to version 1.

2002-04-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.[ch]
    Finished base implementation of read/write mode. Much more testing still
    needed.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Preliminary tests for read/write mode added. More needed.

2002-04-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.[ch]
    Removed sf_open_read() and sf_open_write() functions,replacting them with
    sf_open() which takes an extra mode parameter (SF_OPEN_READ, SF_OPEN_WRITE,
    or SF_OPEN_RDWR). This new function sf_open can now be modified to allow
    opening a file formodification (RDWR).

2002-04-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.c
    Completed merging of separate xxx_open_read() and xxx_open_write()
    functions. All tests pass.

2002-04-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/au.c
    Massive refactoring required to merge au_open_read() with au_open_write()
    to create au_open().

2002-04-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.c
    Started changes required to allow a sound file to be opened in read/write
    mode, with separate file pointers for read and write. This involves merging
    of encoder/decoder functions like pcm_read_init() and pcm_write_init()
    int a new function pcm_init() as well as doing something similar for all
    the file type specific functions ie aiff_open_read() and aiff_open_write()
    were merged to make the function aiff_open().

2002-04-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/file_io.c
    New file containing psf_fopen(), psf_fread(), psf_fwrite(), psf_fseek() and
    psf_ftell() functions. These function will replace use of fopen/fread/fwrite
    etc and allow access to files larger than 2 gigabytes on a number of 32 bit
    OSes (Linux on x86, 32 bit Solaris user space apps, Win32 and MacOS).

    * src/*.c
    Replaced all instances of fopen with psf_open, fread with psd_read, fwrite
    with psf_write and so on.

2002-03-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/dwvw.c
    Finally fixed all known problems with 12, 16 and 24 bit DWVW encoding.

    * tests/floating_point_test.c
    Added tests for 12, 16 and 24 bit DWVW encoding.

2002-03-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * m4/endian.m4
    Defines a new m4 macro AC_C_FIND_ENDIAN, for determining the endian-ness of
    the target CPU. It first checks for the definition of BYTE_ORDER in
    <endian.h>, then in <sys/types.h> and <sys/param.h>. If none of these work
    and the C compiler is not a cross compiler it compiles and runs a program
    to test for endian-ness. If the compiler is a cross compiler it makes a
    guess based on $target_cpu.

    * configure.in
    Modified to use AC_C_FIND_ENDIAN.

    * src/sfendian.h
    Simplified.

2002-02-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/floating_point_test.c
    Tests completely rewritten using the dft_cmp function. Now able to
    calculate a quick guesstimate of the Signal to Noise Ratio of the encoder.

2002-02-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/dft_cmp.[ch]
    New files containing functions for comparing pre and post lossily
    compressed data using a quickly hacked DFT.

    * tests/utils.[ch]
    New files containing functions for saving pre and post encoded data in a
    file readable by the GNU Octave package.

2002-02-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * m4/lrint.m4 m4/lrintf.m4
    Fixed m4 macros to define HAVE_LRINT and HAVE_LRINTF even when the test
    is cached.

2002-02-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/floating_point_test.c
    Fixed improper use of strncat ().

2002-02-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/headerless_test.c
    New test program to test the ability to open and read a known file type as a
    RAW header-less file.

2002-02-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/losy_comp_test.c
    Added a test to ensure that the data read from a file is not all zeros.

    * examples/sfconvert.c
    Added "-gsm610" encoding types.

2002-01-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * examples/sfconvert.c
    Added "-dwvw12", "-dwvw16" and "-dwvw24" encoding types.

    * tests/dwvw_test.c
    New file for testing DWVW encoder/decoder.

2002-01-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/aiff.c
    Improved reporting of encoding types.

    * src/voc.c
    Clean up.

2002-01-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/dwvw.c
    New file implementing lossless Delta Word Variable Width (DWVW) encoding.
    Reading 12 bit DWVW is now working.

    * src/aiff.c common.h sndfile.c
    Added hooks for DWVW encoded AIFF and RAW files.

2002-01-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/w64.c
    Robustify header parsing.

    * src/wav_w64.h
    Header file wav.h was renamed to wav_w64.h to signify sharing of
    definitions across the two file types.

    * src/wav.c src/w64.c src/wav_w64.c
    Refactoring.
    Modified and moved functions with a high degree of similarity between
    wav.c and w64.c to wav_w64.c.

2002-01-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/w64.c
    Completed work on getting read and write working.

    * examples/sfplay.c
    Added code to scale floating point data so it plays at a reasonable volume.

    * tests/Makefile.am tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for W64 files.

2002-01-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.c
    Modded all code in file header writing routines to use
    psf_new_binheader_writef().
    Removed psf_binheader_writef() from src/common.c.
    Globally replaced psf_new_binheader_writef with psf_binheader_writef.

2002-01-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.c
    Modded all code in file parsing routines to use psf_new_binheader_readf().
    Removed psf_binheader_readf() from src/common.c.
    Globally replaced psf_new_binheader_readf with psf_binheader_readf.

    * src/common.[ch]
    Added new function psf_new_binheader_writef () which will soon replace
    psf_binheader_writef (). The new function has basically the same function
    as the original but has a more flexible and capable interface. It also
    allows the writing of 64 bit integer values for files contains 64 bit file
    offsets.

2002-01-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/formats.c src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h
    Added code allowing full enumeration of supported file formats via the
    sf_command () interface.
    This feature will allow applications to avoid needing recompilation when
    support for new file formats are added to libsndfile.

    * tests/command_test.c
    Added test code for the above feature.

    * examples/list_formats.c
    New file. An example of the use of the supported file enumeration
    interface. This program lists all the major formats and for each major
    format the supported subformats.

2002-01-10  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.[ch] tests/*.c
    Changed command parameter of sf_command () function from a test string to
    an int. The valid values for the command parameter begin with SFC_ and are
    listed in src/sndfile.h.

2001-12-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/formats.c src/sndfile.c
    Added an way of enumerating a set of common file formats using the
    sf_command () interface. This interface was suggested by Dominic Mazzoni,
    one of the main authors of Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).

2001-12-26  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added checking of filename parameter in sf_open_read (). Previousy, if a
    NULL pointer was passed the library would segfault.

2001-12-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.c src/common.h
    Changed the len parameter of the endswap_*_array () functions from type
    int to type long.

    * src/pcm.c
    Fixed a problem which

2001-12-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added conditional #include <sys/types.h> for EMX/gcc on OS/2. Thanks to
    Paul Hartman for pointing this out.

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c tests/floating_point_test.c
    Added definitions for M_PI for when it isn't defined in <math.h>.

2001-11-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/ircam.c
    Re-implemented the header reader. Old version was making incorrect
    assumptions about the endian-ness of the file from the magic number at the
    start of the file. The new code looks at the integer which holds the
    number of channels and determines the endian-ness from that.

2001-11-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/aiff.c
    Added support for other AIFC types ('raw ', 'in32', '23ni').
    Further work on IMA ADPCM encoding.

2001-11-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/ima_adpcm.c
    Renamed from wav_ima_adpcm.c. This file will soon handle IMA ADPCM
    encodings for both WAV and AIFF files.

    * src/aiff.c
    Started adding IMA ADPCM support.

2001-11-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/double.c
    New file for handling double precision floating point (SF_FORMAT_DOUBLE)
    data.

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c src/au.c src/raw.c
    Added support for SF_FORMAT_DOUBLE data.

    * src/common.[ch]
    Addition of endswap_long_array () for endian swapping 64 bit integers. This
    function will work correctly on processors with 32 bit and 64 bit longs.
    Optimised endswap_short_array () and endswap_int_array ().

    * tests/pcm_test.c
    Added and extra check. After the first file of each type is written to disk
    a checksum is performed of the first 64 bytes and checked against a pre-
    calculated value. This will work whatever the endian-ness of the host
    machine.

2001-11-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/aiff.c
    Added handling of u-law, A-law encoded AIFF files. Thanks to Tom Erbe for
    supplying example files.

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added tests for above.

    * src/common.h src/*.c
    Removed function typedefs from common.h and function pointer casting in all
    the other files. This allows the compiler to perform proper type checking.
    Hopefully this will prevernt problems like the sf_seek bug for OpenBSD,
    BeOS etc.

    * src/common.[ch]
    Added new function psf_new_binheader_readf () which will eventually replace
    psf_binheader_readf (). The new function has basically the same function as
    the original but has a more flexible and capable interface. It also allows
    the reading of 64 bit integer values for files contains 64 bit file
    offsets.

2001-11-26  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/voc.c
    Completed implementation of VOC file handling. Can now handle 8 and 16 bit
    PCM, u-law and A-law files with one or two channels.

    * src/write_read_test.c tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added tests for VOC files.

2001-11-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/float_cast.h
    Added inline asm version of lrint/lrintf for MacOS. Solution provided by
    Stephane Letz.

    * src/voc.c
    More work on this braindamaged format. The VOC files produced by SoX also
    have a number of inconsistencies.

2001-11-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/paf.c
    Added support for 8 bit PCM PAF files.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for 8 bit PAF files.

2001-11-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/pcm_test.c
    New test program to test for correct scaling of integer values between
    different sized integer containers (ie short -> int).
    The new specs for libsndfile state that when the source and destination
    containers are of a different size, the most significant bit of the source
    value becomes the most significant bit of the destination container.

    * src/pcm.c src/paf.c
    Modified to pass the above test program.

    * tests/write_read_test.c tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Modified to work with the new scaling rules.

2001-11-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/raw.c tests/write_read_test.c tests/write_read_test.c
    Added ability to do raw reads/writes of float, u-law and A-law files.

    * src/*.[ch] examples/*.[ch] tests/*.[ch]
    Removed dependance on pcmbitwidth field of SF_INFO struct and moved to new
    SF_FORMAT_* types and use of SF_ENDIAN_BIG/LITTLE/CPU.

2001-11-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.[ch]
    Started implmentation of major changes documented in doc/version1.html.

    Removed all usage of off_t which is not part of the ISO C standard. All
    places which were using it are now using type long which is the type of
    the offset parameter for the fseek function.
    This should fix problems on BeOS, MacOS and *BSD like systems which were
    failing "make check" because sizeof (long) != sizeof (off_t).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the boundary between version 1 of the library above and version 0 below.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2001-11-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * examples/sfplay_beos.cpp
    Added BeOS version of sfplay.c. This needs to be compiled using a C++
    compiler so is therefore not built by default. Thanks to Marcus Overhagen
    for providing this.

2001-11-10  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * examples/sfplay.c
    New example file showing how libsndfile can be used to read and play a
    sound file.
    At the moment on Linux is supported. Others will follow in the near future.

2001-11-09  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/pcm.c
    Fixed problem with normalisation code where a value of 1.0 could map to
    a value greater than MAX_SHORT or MAX_INT. Thanks to Roger Dannenberg for
    pointing this out.

2001-11-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/pcm.c
    Fixed scaling issue when reading/writing 8 bit files using
    sf_read/sf_write_short ().
    On read, values are scaled so that the most significant bit in the char
    ends up in the most significant bit of the short. On write, values are
    scaled so that most significant bit in the short ends up as the most
    significant bit in the char.

2001-11-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/au.c src/sndfile.c
    Added support for 32 bit float data in big and little endian AU files.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for 32 bit float data in AU files.

2001-11-06  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Finalised testing of stereo files where possible.

2001-11-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Fixed bug in writing stereo MS ADPCM WAV files. Thanks to Xu Xin for
    pointing out this problem.

2001-10-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Modified function srate2blocksize () to handle 44k1Hz stereo files.

2001-10-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/w64.c
    Added support for Sonic Foundry 64 bit WAV format. As Linux (my main
    development platform) does not yet support 64 bit file offsets by default,
    current handling of this file format treats everything as 32 bit and fails
    openning the file, if it finds anything that goes beyond 32 bit values.

    * src/sndfile.[hc] src/common.h src/Makefile.am
    Added hooks for W64 support.

2001-10-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in
    Added more warnings options to CFLAGS when the gcc compiler is detected.

    * src/*.[ch] tests/*.c examples/*.c
    Started fixing the warning messages due to the new CFLASG.

    * src/voc.c
    More work on VOC file read/writing.

    * src/paf.c
    Found that PAF files were not checking the normalisation flag when reading
    or writing floats and doubles. Fixed it.

    * tests/floating_point_test.c
    Added specific test for the above problem.

    * src/float_cast.h src/pcm.c
    Added a section for Win32 to define lrint () and lrintf () in the header
    and implement it in the pcm.c

2001-10-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * sndfile-config.in m4/sndfile.m4
    These files were donated by Conrad Parker who also provided instructions
    on how to install them using autoconf/automake.

    * src/float_cast.h
    Fiddled around with this file some more. On Linux and other gcc supported
    OSes use the C99 functions lrintf() and lrint() for casting from floating
    point to int without incurring the huge perfromance penalty (particularly
    on the i386 family) caused by the regular C cast from float to int.
    These new C99 functions replace the FLOAT_TO_* and DOUBLE_TO_* macros which
    I had been playing with.

    * configure.in m4/lrint.m4 m4/lrintf.m4
    Add detection of these functions.

2001-10-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/voc.c
    Completed code for reading VOC files containing a single audio data
    segment.
    Started implementing code to handle files with multiple VOC_SOUND_DATA
    segments but couldn't be bothered finishing it. Multiple segment files can
    have different sample rates for different sections and other nasties like
    silence and repeat segments.

2001-10-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.h src/*.c
    Removed SF_PRIVATE struct field fdata and replaced it with extra_data.

    * src/voc.c
    Further development of the read part of this woefult file format.

2001-10-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/float_cast.h
    Implemented gcc and i386 floating point to int cast macros. Standard cast
    will be used when not on gcc for i385.

    * src/pcm.c
    Modified all uses of FLOAT/DOUBLE_TO_INT and FLOAT/DOUBLE_TO_SHORT casts to
    comply with macros in float_cast.h.

2001-10-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/voc.c
    Changed the TYPE_xxx enum names to VOC_TYPE_xxx to prevent name clashes
    on MacOS with CodeWarrior 6.0.

    * MacOS/MacOS-readme.txt
    Updated the compile instructions. Probably still need work as I don't have
    access to a Mac.

2001-10-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c common.c
    Changed all references to snprintf to LSF_SNPRINTF and all vsnprintf to
    LSF_VSNPRINTF. LSF_VSNPRINTF and LSF_VSNPRINTF are defined in common.h.

    * src/common.h
    Added checking of HAVE_SNPRINTF and HAVE_VSNPRINTF and defining
    LSF_VSNPRINTF and LSF_VSNPRINTF to appropriate values.

    * src/missing.c
    New file containing a minimal implementation of snprintf and vsnprintf
    functions named missing_snprintf and missing_vsnprintf respectively. These
    are only compliled into the binary if snprintf and/or vsnprintf are not
    available.

2001-09-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/ircam.c
    New file to handle Berkeley/IRCAM/CARL files.

    * src/sndfile.c src/common.h
    Modified for IRCAM handling.

    * tests/*.c
    Added tests for IRCAM files.

2001-09-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c
    Apparently microsoft windows (tm) doesn't like ulaw and Alaw WAV files with
    20 byte format chunks (contrary to ms's own documentation). Fixed the WAV
    header writing code to generate smaller ms compliant ulaw and Alaw WAV
    files.

2001-09-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/stdio_test.sh tests/stdio_test.c
    Shell script was rewritten as a C program due to incompatibilities of the
    sh shell on Linux and Solaris.

2001-09-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/stdio_test.sh tests/stdout_test.c tests/stdin_test.c
    New test programs to verify the correct operation of reading from stdin and
    writing to stdout.

    * src/sndfile.c wav.c au.c nist.c paf.c
    Fixed a bugs uncovered by the new test programs above.

2001-09-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c wav.c
    Fixed a bug preventing reading a file from stdin. Found by T. Narita.

2001-09-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.h
    Fixed a problem on OpenBSD 2.9 which was causing sf_seek() to fail on IMA
    WAV files. Root cause was the declaration of the func_seek typedef not
    matching the functions it was actually being used to point to. In OpenBSD
    sizeof (off_t) != sizeof (int). Thanks to Heikki Korpela for allowing me
    to log into his OpenBSD machine to debug this problem.

2001-09-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Implemented sf_command ("norm float").

    * src/*.c
    Implemented handling of sf_command ("set-norm-float"). Float normalization
    can now be turned on and off.

    * tests/double_test.c
    Renamed to floating_point_test.c. Modified to include tests for all scaled
    reads and writes of floats and doubles.

    * src/au_g72x.c
    Fixed bug in normalization code found with improved floating_point_test
    program.

    * src/wav.c
    Added code for parsing 'INFO' and 'LIST' chunks. Will be used for extract
    text annotations from WAV files.

    * src/aiff.c

    text annotations from WAV files.

2001-09-02  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * examples/sf_info.c example/Makefile.am
    Renamed to sndfile_info.c. The program sndfile_info will now be installed
    when the library is installed.

    * src/float_cast.h
    New file defining floating point to short and int casts. These casts will
    eventually replace all flot and double casts to short and int. See comments
    at the top of the file for the reasoning.

    * src/*.c
    Changed all default float and double casts to short or int with macros
    defined in floatcast.h. At the moment these casts do nothing. They will be
    replaced with faster float to int cast operations in the near future.

2001-08-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/command_test.c
    New file for testing sf_command () functionality.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Revisiting of error return values of some functions.
    Started implementing sf_command () a new function will allow on-the-fly
    modification of library behaviour, or instance, sample value scaling.

    * src/common.h
    Added hook for format specific sf_command () calls to SNDFILE struct.

    * doc/api.html
    Updated and errors corrected.

    * doc/command.html
    New documentation file explaining new sf_command () function.

2001-08-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed error return values from sf_read*() and sf_write*(). There were
    numerous instances of -1 being returned through size_t. These now all set
    error int the SF_PRIVATE struct and return 0. Thanks to David Viens for
    spotting this.

2001-08-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.c
    Fixed use of va_arg() calls that were causing warning messages with the
    latest version of gcc (thanks Maurizio Umberto Puxeddu).

2001-07-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.c src/sfendian.h
    Moved definition of MAKE_MARKER macro to sfendian.h

2001-07-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified sf_get_lib_version () so that version string will be visible using
    the Unix strings command.

    * examples/Makefile.am examples/sfinfo.c
    Renamed sfinfo program and source code to sf_info. This prevents a name
    clash with the program included with libaudiofile.

2001-07-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/read_seek_test.c tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added tests for sf_read_float () and sf_readf_float ().

    * src/voc.c
    New files for handling Creative Voice files (not complete).

    * src/samplitude.c
    New files for handling Samplitude files (not complete).

2001-07-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/aiff.c src/au.c src/paf.c src/svx.c src/wav.c
    Converted these files to using psf_binheader_readf() function. Will soon be
    ready to attempt to make reading writing from pipes work reliably.

    * src/*.[ch]
    Added code for sf_read_float () and sf_readf_float () methods of accessing
    file data.

2001-07-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/paf.c src/wav_gsm610.c
    Removed two printf()s which had escaped notice for some time (thanks
    Sigbjørn Skjæret).

2001-07-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav_gsm610.c
    Fixed a bug which prevented GSM 6.10 encoded WAV files generated by
    libsndfile from being played in Windoze (thanks klay).

2001-07-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.[ch]
    Implemented psf_binheader_readf() which will do for file header reading what
    psf_binheader_writef() did for writing headers. Will eventually allow
    libsndfile to read and write from pipes, including named pipes.

2001-07-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * MacOS/config.h Win32/config.h
    Attempted to bring these two files uptodate with src/config.h. As I don't
    have access to either of these systems support for them may be completely
    broken.

2001-06-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/float32.c
    Fixed bug for big endian processors that can't read 32 bit IEEE floats. Now
    tested on Intel x86 and UltraSparc processors.

2001-06-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/aiff.c
    Modified to allow REX files (from Propellorhead's Recycle and Reason
    programs) to be read.
    REX files are basically an AIFF file with slightly unusual sequence of
    chunks (AIFF files are supposed to allow any sequence) and some extra
    application specific information.
    Not yet able to write a REX file as the details of the application specific
    data is unknown.

2001-06-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed endian bug when reading PEAK chunk on big endian machines.

    * src/common.c
    Fixed endian bug when reading PEAK chunk on big endian machines with
    --enable-force-broken-float configure option.
    Fix psf_binheader_writef for (FORCE_BROKEN_FLOAT ||______)

2001-06-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in src/config.h.in
    Removed old CAN_READ_WRITE_x86_IEEE configure variable now that float
    capabilities are detected at run time.
    Added FORCE_BROKEN_FLOAT to allow testing of broken float code on machines
    where the processor can in fact handle floats correctly.

    * src/float32.c
    Rejigged code reading and writing of floats on broken processors.

    * m4/
    Removed this directory and all its files as they are no longer needed.

2001-06-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/peak_chunk_test.c
    New test to validate reading and writing of peak chunk.

    * examples/sfconvert
    Added -float32 option.

    * src/*.c
    Changed all error return values to negative values (ie the negative of what
    they were).

    * src/sndfile.c tests/error_test.c
    Modified to take account of the previous change.

2001-06-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/float32.c
    File renamed from wav_float.c and renamed function to something more
    general.
    Added runtime detection of floating point capabilities.
    Added recording of peaks during write for generation of PEAK chunk.

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added handing for PEAK chunk for floating point files. PEAK is read when the
    file headers are read and generated when the file is closed. Logic is in
    place for adding PEAK chunk to end of file when writing to a pipe (reading
    and writing from/to pipe to be implemented soon).

    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified sf_signal_max () to use PEAK values if present.

2001-06-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.c
    Added pcm_read_init () and pcm_write_init () to src/pcm.c and removed all
    other calls to functions in this file from the filetype specific files.

    * src/*.c
    Added alaw_read_init (), alaw_write_int (), ulaw_read_init () and
    ulaw_write_init () and removed all other calls to functions in alaw.c and
    ulaw.c from the filetype specific files.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests to validate sf_seek () on all file types.

    * src/raw.c
    Implemented raw_seek () function to fix a bug where
    sf_seek (file, 0, SEEK_SET) on a RAW file failed.

    * src/paf.c
    Fixed a bug in paf24_seek () found due to added seeks tests in
    tests/write_read_test.c

2001-06-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/read_seek_test.c
    Fixed a couple of broken binary files.

    * src/aiff.c src/wav.c
    Added handling of PEAK chunks on file read.

2001-05-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * check_libsndfile.py
    New file for the regression testing of libsndfile.
    check_libsndfile.py is a Python script which reads in a file containing
    filenames of audio files. Each file is checked by running the examples/sfinfo
    program on them and checking for error or warning messages in the libsndfile
    log buffer.

    * check_libsndfile.list
    This is an example list of audio files for use with check_libsndfile.py

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Changed the defined value of M_PI for math header files which don't have it.
    This fixed validation test failures on MetroWerks compilers. Thanks to Lord
    Praetor Satanus of Acheron for bringing this to my attention.

2001-05-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.[ch]
    Removed psf_header_setf () which was no longer required after refactoring
    and simplification of header writing.
    Added 'z' format specifier to psf_binheader_writef () for zero filling header
    with N bytes. Used by paf.c and nist.c

    * tests/check_log_buffer.c
    New file implementing check_log_buffer () which reads the log buffer of a
    SNDFILE* object and searches for error and warning messages. Calls exit ()
    if any are found.

    * tests/*.c
    Added calls to check_log_buffer () after each call to sf_open_XXX ().

2001-05-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c src/wav_ms_adpcm.c src/wav_gsm610.c

    * src/wav.c
    Changed return type of get_encoding_str () to prevent compiler warnings on
    Mac OSX.

    * src/aiff.c src/au.c
    Major rehack of header writing using psf_binheader_writef ().

2001-05-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    Added comments.
    Name of log buffer changed from strbuffer to logbuffer.
    Name of log buffer index variable changed from strindex to logindex.

    * src/*.[ch]
    Changed name of internal logging function from psf_sprintf () to
    psf_log_printf ().
    Changed name of internal header generation functions from
    psf_[ab]h_printf () to psf_asciiheader_printf () and
    psf_binheader_writef ().
    Changed name of internal header manipulation function psf_hsetf () to
    psf_header_setf ().

2001-05-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/nist.c
    Fixed reading and writing of sample_byte_format header. "01" means little
    endian and "10" means big endian regardless of bit width.

    * configure.in
    Detect Mac OSX and disable -Wall and -pedantic gcc options. Mac OSX is
    way screwed up and spews out buckets of warning messages from the system
    headers.
    Added --disable-gcc-opt configure option (sets gcc optimisation to -O0 ) for
    easier debugging.
    Made decision to harmonise source code version number and .so library
    version number. Future releases will stick to this rule.

    Fixed bug which prevented writing of G723 24kbps AU files.

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Corrrection to options for G723 tests.

    * configure.in
    Added --disable-gcc-pipe option for DJGPP compiler (gcc on MS-DOS) which
    doesn't allow gcc -pipe option.

2000-09-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/ulaw.c src/alaw.c src/wav_imaadpcm.c src/msadpcm.c src/wav_gsm610.c
    Fixed normailsation bugs shown up by new double_test program.

2000-08-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/pcm.c
    Fixed bug in normalisation code (spotted by Steve Lhomme).

    * tests/double_test.c
    New file to test scaled and unscaled sf_read_double() and sf_write_double()
    functions.

2000-08-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * COPYING

    * src/newpcm.h
    New file to contain a complete rewrite of the PCM data handling.

2000-08-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed a leak of FILE* pointers in sf_open_write(). Thanks to Sigbjørn

    Added more error reporting in read_fmt_chunk().

1999-12-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * examples/sfinfo.c
    Modified program to accept multiple filenames from the command line.

1999-11-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    Fixed put_int() and put_short() macros used by _psf_hprintf() which were
    causing seg. faults on Sparc Solaris.

1999-11-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.c
    Added string.h to includes. Thanks to Sigbjxrn Skjfret.

    pointing this out.

1999-09-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/paf.c
    Fixed a bug with reading and writing 24 bit stereo PAF files. This problem
    came to light when implementing tests for the new functions which operate
    in terms of frames rather than items.

1999-09-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified file type detection to use first 12 bytes of file rather than
    file name extension. Required this because NIST files use the same
    filename extension as Microsoft WAV files.

    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h
    Added short, int and double read/write functions which work in frames
    rather than items. This was originally suggested by Maurizio Umberto
    Puxeddu.

1999-09-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/svx.c
    Finished off implementation of write using __psf_hprintf().

1999-09-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/common.h
    Added a buffer to SF_PRIVATE for writing the header. This is required
    to make generating headers for IFF/SVX files easier as well as making
    it easier to do re-write the headers which will be required when
    sf_rewrite_header() is implemented.

    * src/common.c
    Implemented __psf_hprintf() function. This is an internal function
    which is documented briefly just above the code.

1999-09-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed a bug in sf_write_raw() where it was returning incorrect values
    (thanks to Richard Dobson for finding this one). Must put in a test
    routine for sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw.

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed default FORMsize in __aiff_open_write ().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added copy of filename to internal data structure. IFF/SVX files
    contain a NAME header chunk. Both sf_open_read() and sf_open_write()
    copy the file name (less the leading path information) to the
    filename field.

    * src/svx.c
    Started implementing writing of files.

1999-08-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/svx.c
    New file for reading/writing 8SVX and 16SVX files.

    * src/sndfile.[ch] src/common.h
    Changes for SVX files.

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed header parsing when unknown chunk is found.

1999-08-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/paf.c
    New file for reading/writing Ensoniq PARIS audio file format.

    * src/sndfile.[ch] src/common.h
    Changes for PAF files.

    * src/sndfile.[ch]

    * MacOS/
    Added a new directory for the MacOS config.h file and the
    readme file.

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed calculation of datalength when reading SSND chunk. Thanks to
    Sigbjørn Skjæret for pointing out this error.

1999-07-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h src/raw.c
    Further fixing of #includes for MacOS.

1999-07-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added call to ferror () in main header parsing loop of __XXX_open_read
    functions. This should fix problems on platforms (MacOS, AmigaOS) where
    fseek()ing or fread()ing beyond the end of the file puts the FILE*
    stream in an error state until clearerr() is called.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for RAW header-less PCM files.

    * src/common.h
    Moved definition of struct tribyte to pcm.c which is the only place
    which needs it.

    * src/pcm.c
    Modified all code which assumed sizeof (struct tribyte) == 3. This code
    did not work on MacOS. Thanks to Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.

    * src/au.c
    Removed <sys/stat.h> from list of #includes (not being used).

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.

    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.

    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific typedef for off_t.

    * MacOS-readme.txt
    New file with instructions for building libsndfile under MacOS. Thanks
    to Ben "Jacobs" for supplying these instructions.

1999-07-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in
    Removed sndfile.h from generated file list as there were no longer
    any autoconf substitutions being made.

    * src/raw.c
    New file for handling raw header-less PCM files. In order to open these
    for read, the user must specify format, pcmbitwidth and channels in the
    SF_INFO struct when calling sf_open_read ().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added support for raw header-less PCM files.

1999-07-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * examples/sfinfo.c
    Removed options so the sfinfo program always prints out all the information.

1999-07-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/alaw.c
    New file for A-law encoding (similar to u-law).

    * tests/alaw_test.c
    New test program to test the A-law encode/decode lookup tables.

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added tests for a-law encoded WAV, AU and AULE files.

1999-07-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c src/au.c
    Removed second "#include <unistd.h>". Thanks to Ben "Jacobs" for pointing
    this out.

1999-07-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/ulaw_test.c
    New test program to test the u-law encode/decode lookup tables.

1999-07-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.h
    Made corrections to comments on the return values from sf_seek ().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed boundary condition checking bug and accounting bug in sf_read_raw ().

1999-07-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/au.c src/ulaw.c
    Finished implementation of u-law encoded AU files.

    * src/wav.c
    Implemented reading and writing of u-law encoded WAV files.

    * tests/
    Changed name of adpcm_test.c to lossy_comp_test.c. This test program
    will now be used to test Ulaw and Alaw encoding as well as APDCM.
    Added tests for Ulaw encoded WAV files.

1999-07-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Initialised amp variable in gen_signal() to remove compiler warning.

1999-07-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/aiff.c
    In __aiff_open_read () prevented fseek()ing beyond end of file which

    Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.

    *src/wav.c
    Fixed as above in __wav_open_read ().

1999-07-01    Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Implemented MS ADPCM encoding. Code cleanup of decoder.

    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Added tests for MS ADPCM WAV files.

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed incorrect parameter in call to srate2blocksize () from

    Fixed all warnings resulting from use of -Wconversion.

1999-06-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c
    Added fact chunk handling on read and write for all non WAVE_FORMAT_PCM
    WAV files.

    * src/wav_ima.c
    Changed block alignment to be dependant on sample rate. This should make
    WAV files created with libsndfile compatible with the MS Windows media
    players.

    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Reimplemented adpcm_test_short and implemented adpcm_test_int and
    adpcm_test_double.
    Now have full testing of IMA ADPCM WAV file read, write and seek.

1999-06-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav_float.c
    Fixed function prototype for x86f2d_array () which was causing ocassional
    seg. faults on Sparc Solaris machines.

1999-06-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed bug in __aiff_close where the length fields in the header were
    not being correctly calculated before writing.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Modified to detect the above bug in WAV, AIFF and AU files.

1999-06-12    Erik de Castro Lopo     <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * Win32/*
    Added a contribution from Albert Faber to allow libsndfile to compile
    under Win32 systems. libsndfile will now be used as part of LAME the
    the MPEG 1 Layer 3 encoder (http://internet.roadrunner.com/~mt/mp3/).

1999-06-11    Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * configure.in
    Changed to reflect previous changes.

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed incorrect calculation of bytespersec header field (IMA ADPCM only).

    Fixed bug when writing from int or double data to IMA ADPCM file. Will need
    to write test code for this.

    Fixed bug in __ima_write () whereby the length of the current block was
    calculated incorrectly. Thanks to Jongcheon Park for pointing this out.

1999-03-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/*.c
    Changed all read/write/lseek function calls to fread/fwrite/
    fseek/ftell and added error checking of return values from
    fread and fwrite in critical areas of the code.

    * src/au.c
    Fixed incorrect datasize element in AU header on write.

    * tests/error_test.c
    Add new test to check all error values have an associated error
    string. This will avoid embarrassing real world core dumps.

1999-03-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added handling for unknown chunk markers in the file.

1999-03-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Filled in missing error strings in SndfileErrors array. Missing entries
    can cause core dumps when calling sf_error-str (). Thanks to Sam
    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com> for finding this problem.

1999-03-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Work on wav_ms_adpcm.c uncovered a bug in __ima_read () when reading
    stereo files. Caused by not adjusting offset into buffer of decoded
    samples for 2 channels. A similar bug existed in __ima_write ().
    Need a test for stereo ADPCM files.

    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Decoder working correctly.

    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com>.

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed bug when reading beyond end of data section due to not
    checking pima->blockcount.
    This uncovered __ima_seek () bug due to pima->blockcount being set
    before calling __ima_init_block ().

1999-03-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c
    Started implementing MS ADPCM decoder.
    If file is WAVE_FORMAT_ADPCM and length of data chunk is odd, this
    encoder seems to add an extra byte. Why not just give an even data
    length?

1999-03-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/wav.c
    Split code out of wav.c to create wav_float.c and wav_ima_adpcm.c.
    This will make it easier to add and debug other kinds of WAV files
    in future.

1999-03-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/
    Added adpcm_test.c which implements test functions for

    incorrect read count when reading past end of file.
    Fixed bug in sf_seek () when seeking backwards from end of file.

    * tests/read_seek_test.c
    Added multiple read test to short_test(), int_test () and
    double_test ().
    Added extra chunk to all test WAV files to test that reading
    stops at end of 'data' chunk.

1999-02-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for little DEC endian AU files.

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed bug in let2s_array (cptr was not being initialised).

    * src/sndfile.c:
    Fixed bug in sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw. sf_seek should
    now work when using these functions.

1999-02-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * tests/write_read_test.c:
    Force test_buffer array to be double aligned. Sparc Solaris
    requires this.

1999-02-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed a bug which was causing errors in the reading
    and writing of 24 bit PCM files.

    * doc/api.html
    Finished of preliminary documentaion.

1999-02-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com>

    * src/aiff.c:
    Changed reading of 'COMM' chunk to avoid reading an int
    which overlaps an int (4 byte) boundary.

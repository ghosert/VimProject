Here's a list of what I (erikd AT mega-nerd DOT com) think needs to be 
done. The list is by no means exhaustive and people are encouraged to 
email me with suggestions. 

  o Add pipe in/out capabilities. libsndfile should be able to read 
	its input from a pipe and write its output to a pipe.

  o Add checks of the error state after fseek???? Use ferror ().

  o Modify tests/lossy_comp_test.c to add tests for stereo files.

  o Testing compilation and correctness on more platforms.

  o Improve testing routines. Must test all combinations of inputs
    and outputs.

  o Test sf_seek function on write???

  o Add more sound file formats. People should contact me with their
    requirements. 

  o Add support for accessing sound formats with multiple audio
    data sections (ie samples within tracker files, Soundfont II and 
    multi-sample sampler formats). 

  o Add an interface to allow reading and writing of sample loop points 
    and other info within AIFF and other file formats. This must be a 
    general solution.

  o Improve documentation. Is HTML documentation good enough?

  o Look into the possibility of optional sample rate convert on file 
    read.

As I am the person who knows libsndfile best, I can probably implement 
any new features faster than anybody else (and you can spend your time
writing applications with libsndfile). All I need is some 
documentation and some sample files. Please contact me before emailing
me documentation and sample files. I would much rather pull them off
the web than have them clogging up my email inbox.

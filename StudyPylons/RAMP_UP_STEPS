# Activate virtual python env first:
# source ~/mydevenv/bin/activate
# To create a new project named helloword and running it:
# $ paster create -t pylons StudyPylons
# cd StudyPylons
# $ paster serve --reload development.ini
# Visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see welcome page.
# To create a controller, this will produce a module which is located at studypylons/controllers/hello.py:
# $ paster controller hello
# Visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello/index
# For SQLAlchemy:
#     1. Put model classes like person.py, address.py into studypylons/model/
#     2. Run "paster setup-app development.ini" to create the tables in the database, this command will call studypylons/websetup.py
# Visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/person/index to see a sample for SQLAlchemy

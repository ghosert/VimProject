1. When exception raised from codes, the error log will not be output into the logfile specified in production.ini file(say server.log), but it's logged in uwsgi's logging file(say uwsgi.log).

Try context=Exception and define the custom view to invoking log.error to make sure the error log will go to server.log rather than uwsgi.log.

And see whether this change will impact 'paster serve development.ini --realod'

Check out whether pyramid_exclog is a solution.

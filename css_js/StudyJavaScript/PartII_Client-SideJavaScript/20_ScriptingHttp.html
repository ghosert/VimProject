		// Scripting HTTP

		// The <img>, <iframe>, and <script> tags have src properties. When a script sets these properties to a URL,
		// an HTTP GET request is initiated to download the content of the URL.
		/*
			Although HTTP scripting with <img>, <iframe>, and <script> tags is possible, it is harder than it sounds to
			do it portably, and this chapter focuses on another, more powerful way to do it. The XMLHttpRequest
			object is well supported in modern browsers and provides full access to the HTTP protocol, including the
			ability to make POST and HEAD requests, in addition to regular GET requests. XMLHttpRequest can return
			the web server's response synchronously or asynchronously, and can return the content as text or as a
			DOM document. Despite its name, the XMLHttpRequest object is not limited to use with XML documents:
			it can fetch any kind of text document. The XMLHttpRequest object is the key feature of a web application
			architecture known as Ajax.

		// XMLHttpRequest Security
		/**
			As part of the same-origin security policy (see Section 13.8.2.), the XMLHttpRequest object can issue
			HTTP requests only to the server from which the document that uses it was downloaded. This is a
			reasonable restriction, but you can circumvent it if you need to, by using a server-side script as a proxy to
			fetch the content of some off-site URL for you.
			This XMLHttpRequest security restriction has one very important implication: XMLHttpRequest makes
			HTTP requests and does not work with other URL schemes. It cannot work with URLs that use the file://
			protocol, for example. This means that you cannot test XMLHttpRequest scripts from your local filesystem.
			You must upload your test scripts to a web server (or run a server on your desktop). Your test scripts
			must be loaded into your web browser via HTTP in order for them to make HTTP requests of their own.

			There are other ways to handle the server's response, however. As noted at the beginning of this chapter,

			of the XML document with the responseXML property. The value of this property is a DOM Document
			object, and you can search and traverse it using DOM methods.

			Note, however that using XML as a data format may not always be the best choice. Encode data into XML form on the server and
			have your script traverse DOM xml to extract data on the client, which is complex, especially for js client side. Use JSON instead.

			When you receive a json string like "{name : 'jiawei'}" from server, use eval below to "parses" the reponse simply.

		// while waiting for a response to an XMLHttpRequest. Because the browser doesn't provide any feedback when invoking XMLHttpRequest
		// 2. URLs in the location bar does not change, but user may want to bookmark the urls for current application state:
		// The lesson for Ajax application developers is that it remains important to be able to encapsulate application state in a URL and
		// that these URLs should be available to users when necessary.
		// 3. Back button:
		/*
			Application elements that look like hyperlinks should behave like
			hyperlinks and should do real page reloads. This makes them subject to the browser's history mechanism,
			as the user expects. Conversely, application elements that perform scripted HTTP, which is not subject to
			the browser's history mechanism, should not look like hyperlinks.
			Ajax applications should be careful not to use word like "forward/back", this may make user click on Back button which doesn't work for Ajax
			If you use the words above, it should use traditional page loads instead of XMLHttpRequest.

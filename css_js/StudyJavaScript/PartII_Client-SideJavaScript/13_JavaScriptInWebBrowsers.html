			// Your JavaScript code goes here
			<//script>
		**/

		// In XHTML(Like Tapestry TML):
		/** In XHTML, If your JavaScript code contains the < or & characters, these characters are interpreted as XML markup.
		For this reason, it is best to put all JavaScript code within a CDATA section if you are using XHTML:
			<script><![CDATA[// Your JavaScript code goes here
			]]><//script>
		**/
		
		// A single HTML document may contain any number of <script> elements.
		// functions and variables defined in one script are available to all scripts that follow in the same HTML page.
		// For exampe, we define square function in <head> above, but we can refer it here.
		println(square(2));

		// Scripts in External Files
		// PLEASE ALWAYS DO THIS FOR YOUE PROJECTS.
		// <script> src="../../scripts//util.js"<//script>
		// Conclusion: because of src attribute, your javascript program from one web server can employ code exported by other web servers.
		// Much Internet advertising relies on this fact.

		// The <noscript> Tag
		// HTML defines the <noscript> element to hold content that should be rendered only if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.

		// Hiding Scripts from Old Browsers
		// If the old browser did not recognize the <script> tag, use the way below, or the script will be presented as page content.

		// Event Handlers in HTML
		// You can write javascript code in event handlers as one line string and 'javascript:' prefix which is not required.
		// event handler attributes:
		// onclick: if return false, it will not perform any actions on button or link, it's useful for validation on a submit form(submit button).
		// onmousedown, onmouseup
		// onmouseover, onmouseout
		// onchange: <input>, <select>, <textarea>
		// onload: This event handler may appear on the <body> tag and is triggered when the document and its external content
		// (such as images) are fully loaded. The onload handler is often used to trigger code that manipulates the document content
		// because it indicates that the document has reached a stable state and is safe to modify.


		// JavaScript in URLs
		// JavaScript in urls are treated as one line string, so use /**/ instead of // for comments in "JavaScript in URLs".
		// You can test javascript wherever there is a url like address bar in browser.
		// The javascript: pseudoprotocol can be used with HTML attributes whose value should be a URL like:
		// 1. The HRef attribute of a hyperlink.
		// 2. action attribute of a <form> tag.
		// javascript:var now = new Date( ); "<h1>The time is:</h1>" + now;

		// Compared two clauses below: The first one alter the current displayed document, because the the return value of
		// the Window.open( ) method call would be converted to a string and displayed, to avoid this and make sure no changes for current document,
		// Add "void 0" in the end:
		// javascript:window.open("about:blank");
		// javascript:window.open("about:blank"); void 0;

		// Execution of JavaScript Programs
		// When a file has more than one script, the scripts are executed in the order in which they appear
		// Scripts can appear in the <head> or the <body> of an HTML document.

		// Scripts in the <head> typically define functions to be called by other code.
		// They may also declare and initialize variables that other code will use.
		// Scripts in the <body> of a document can do everything that scripts in the <head> can do.
		// It is more common to see calls to document.write( ) in these scripts, however. Scripts in the <body> of a document
		// "may" also access and manipulate document elements and document content that appear before the script.

		// The onload Event Handler
		// onload handler can be registered by setting the onload attribute of the <body> tag.
		// When the onload handler is triggered, the document is fully loaded and parsed, and any document
		// element can be manipulated by JavaScript code. Also means all the other javascripts have been executed
		// so that onload handler can access all functions defined and variables declared by all scripts in the document.
		/**
			Because onload event handlers are invoked after document parsing is complete, they must not call
			document.write( ). Instead of appending to the current document, any such call would instead begin a
			new document and overwrite the current document before the user even had a chance to view it.
		**/ 

		// Event Handlers and JavaScript URLs
		/**
			<script> elements are typically used to define functions, and event handlers are typically used to invoke
			those functions in response to user input. Event handlers can define functions, of course, but this is an
			uncommon (and not very useful) thing to do.
			If an event handler calls document.write( ) on the document of which it is a part, it will overwrite that document and begin a new one.
		**/

		// The onunload Event Hanlder
		/**
			When the user navigates away from a web page, the browser triggers the onunload event handler, giving
			the JavaScript code on that page one final chance to run.
		**/

		// The Window Object as Execution Context
		// All scripts, event handlers, and JavaScript URLs in a document share the same Window object as their global object.

		// Client-side JavaScript is single-threaded.
		// If you must perform enough computation to cause a noticeable delay, break your computation down into discrete subtasks,
		// then use methods such as setTimeout() and setInterval() to run the subtasks in the background while updating a progress indicator
		// that displays feedback to the user.

		// Manipulating the Document During Loading
		/**
			The only consensus that exists in this gray area is that it is safe to manipulate the document once the
			onload event has been triggered, and this is what most JavaScript applications do: they use the onload
			handler to trigger all document modifications.

		// Accessibility
		// The proper role of JavaScript is to enhance the presentation of information, not to take over the presentation of that information.
		// So that screen reader, mobile browser and people who intentionally disables JavaScript will not be bothered.
		// Another important accessibility concern is for users who can use the keyboard but cannot use (or choose not to use)
		// a pointing device such as a mouse.

		// The Same-Origin Policy
		/**
			  Specifically, a script can read only the properties of windows and documents that have the same origin as the document
			that contains the script. The same-origin policy also comes up when scripting HTTP with the XMLHttpRequest object.
			This object allows client-side JavaScript code to make arbitrary HTTP requests but only to the web server from
			which the containing document was loaded.
			  The origin of a document is defined as the protocol, host, and port of the URL from which the document was loaded.
			Documents loaded from different web servers have different origins. Documents loaded through different ports of the
			same host have different origins. And a document loaded with the http: protocol has a different origin than one loaded
			with the https: protocol, even if they come from the same web server.
			  It is important to understand that the origin of the script itself is not relevant to the same-origin policy:
			what matters is the origin of the document in which the script is embedded. Suppose, for example, that a
			script from domain A is included (using the src property of the <script> tag) in a web page in domain B.
			That script has full access to the content of the document that contains it. If the script opens a new
			window and loads a second document from domain B, the script also has full access to the content of that
			second document. But if the script opens a third window and loads a document from domain C (or even
			from domain A) into it, the same-origin policy comes into effect and prevents the script from accessing
			this document.

			Multiple domain issue for a large web site solution about Same-Origin Policy and more details on this topic,
			see pdf version page 343 - 343

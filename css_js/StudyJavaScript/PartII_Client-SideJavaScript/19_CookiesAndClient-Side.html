		// document.cookie:
		// it enables JavaScript code to persistently store data to the user's hard disk and to retrieve data that was previously stored in this way.
		// Client-side persistence is an easy way to give web applications a memory:
		// a web site can store user preferences so that they can be used again when the user revisits the page, for example.
		// Bear in mind, cookie can be read/written and used in both client/server side.
		// in client sde, you can read/write cookie by js.
		// in server side, the request will automatically contain the cookie info for server reading, and the server sider can write cookie as well.


		// An Overview of Cookies

		// 1. EXPIRES & MAX-AGE COOKIE ATTRIBUTE
		// Cookies are transient by default; the values they store last for the duration of the webbrowser session
		// but are lost when the user exits the browser. If you want a cookie to last beyond a single browsing session,
		// you must tell the browser how long you would like it to retain the cookie.
		// setting the EXPIRES attribute to an expiration date in the future or the MAX-AGE attribute specifies the lifetime(in seconds) of the cookie.
		// Setting either of these attributes causes the browser to save the cookie in a local file.
		// Once the expiration date has passed / the max-age lifetime has been exceeded, the browser automatically deletes the cookie from cookie file.

		// 2. PATH COOKIE ATTRIBUTE
		// PATH cookie attribute specifies the web pages with which a cookie is associated.
		// If the web page http://www.example.com/catalog/index.html creates a cookie, for example, that cookie is also visible to
		// http://www.example.com/catalog/order.html and http://www.example.com/catalog/widgets/index.html, but it is not visible to
		// http://www.example.com/about.html.
		// If you want to use cookie values throughout a web site, regardless of which page creates the cookie
		// For example, if a cookie set by http://www.example.com/catalog/widgets/index.html has its path
		// set to "/catalog", that cookie is also visible to http://www.example.com/catalog/order.html. Or, if the path
		// is set to "/", the cookie is visible to any page on the www.example.com web server.

		// 3. DOMAIN COOKIE ATTRIBUTE
		/*
			By default, cookies are accessible only to pages on the same web server from which they were set. Large
			web sites may want cookies to be shared across multiple web servers, however. For example, the server
			at order.example.com may need to read cookie values set from catalog.example.com. This is where the
			next cookie attribute, domain, comes in. IF A COOKIE CREATED BY A PAGE ON CATALOG.EXAMPLE.COM SETS ITS
			PATH ATTRIBUTE TO "/" AND ITS DOMAIN ATTRIBUTE TO ".EXAMPLE.COM", THAT COOKIE IS AVAILABLE TO ALL WEB PAGEs
			ON CATALOG.EXAMPLE.COM, ORDERS.EXAMPLE.COM, AND ANY OTHER SERVER IN THE EXAMPLE.COM DOMAIN. If the
			domain attribute is not set for a cookie, the default is the hostname of the web server that serves the
			page. Note that you cannot set the domain of a cookie to a domain other than the domain of your server.
		*/

		// 4. SECURE COOKIE ATTRIBUTE
		/*
			The final cookie attribute is a boolean attribute named secure that specifies how cookie values are
			transmitted over the network. By default, cookies are insecure, which means that they are transmitted
			over a normal, insecure HTTP connection. If a cookie is marked secure, however, it is transmitted only
			when the browser and server are connected via HTTPS or another secure protocol.
		*/


		// Storing Cookies
		println(document.lastModified);
		println('last cookie: ' + document.cookie);
		document.cookie = "version=" + encodeURIComponent(document.lastModified); // Use encodeURIComponent before storing cookie.
		println(document.cookie);
		println(decodeURIComponent(document.cookie)); // Use decodeURIComponent before retrieving cookie.
		// create a cookie that persists for a year
		document.cookie = "version=" + document.lastModified +
		                  "; max-age=" + (60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
		// obsolete expires attribute
		var nextyear = new Date();
		nextyear.setFullYear(nextyear.getFullYear( ) + 1);
		document.cookie = "version=" + document.lastModified +
						  "; expires=" + nextyear.toGMTString( );
		// Note that the current cookie below doesn't contain cookie properties like expires we set. The cookie property allows you to set but not read.
		println("current cookie: " + document.cookie); 
		// To change the value of cookie, just set its value again using the same name, path and domain along with the new value.
		// set max-age to 0 or use the expires attribute to specify an expiration date that has already passed.

		// Cookie Limitations
		/*
			that the standard does not require browsers to retain more than 300 cookies total, 20
			cookies per web server (for the entire server, not just for your page or site on the server), or 4 KB of data
			per cookie (both name and value count toward this 4 KB limit).
		*/


		// Reading Cookies
		// To determine the value of a particular named cookie, you can use the String.indexOf( ) and String.substring( ) methods,
		// or you can use String.split( ) to break the string into individual cookies.

		// Read the cookie property. This returns all cookies for this document.
		document.cookie = "version=" + encodeURIComponent(document.lastModified);
		var allcookies = document.cookie;
		// Look for the start of the cookie named "version"
		var pos = allcookies.indexOf("version=");
		// If we find a cookie by that name, extract and use its value
		if (pos != -1) {
			var start = pos + 8; // Start of cookie value
			var end = allcookies.indexOf(";", start); // End of cookie value
			if (end == -1) end = allcookies.length;
			var value = allcookies.substring(start, end); // Extract the value
			value = decodeURIComponent(value); // Decode it
			// Now that we have the cookie value, we can use it.
			// In this case, the cookie was previously set to the modification
			// date of the document, so we can use it to see if the document has
			// changed since the user last visited.
			if (value != document.lastModified)
			alert("This document has changed since you were last here");
		}


		// Cookie Example
		// See page 553 - 556


		// Cookie Alternatives
		// Two drawbacks on cookie:
		/*
			They are limited to 4 KB of data.
			Even when cookies are used only for client-side scripting, they are still uploaded to the web server in
			the request for any web page with which they are associated. When the cookies are not used on the
			server, it's a waste of bandwidth.
		*/

		// Alternative one: IE userData Persistence
		// See html sample above and the script code below:
		var memory = document.getElementById("memory"); // Get persistent element
		if (typeof memory.expires == "string") { // Just for IE.

			// Save ...
			memory.setAttribute("username", 'jiawzhang'); // Set data as attributes
			memory.setAttribute("favoriteColor", 'blue');
			var now = (new Date( )).getTime( ); // now, in milliseconds
			var expires = now + 10 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 10 days from now in ms
			memory.expires = (new Date(expires)).toUTCString( ); // convert to a string
			memory.save("myPersistentData"); // Save the data, the string argument can be any.
			// Load ...
			memory.load("myPersistentData"); // Retrieve saved data by name
			var user = memory.getAttribute("username"); // Query attributes
			var color = memory.getAttribute("favoriteColor");
			println("Retrieved user color info: " + user + " " + color);

			// Storing hierarchical data
			// Use XMLDocument property and DOM methods to add content to it before calling save()/load():
			var memory = document.getElementById("memory"); // Get persistent element
			var doc = memory.XMLDocument; // Get its document
			var root = doc.documentElement; // Root element of document
			root.appendChild(doc.createTextNode("data here")); // Store text in document

			// Storage limits
			// The IE persistence mechanism allows much more data to be stored than cookies do. Each page may store
			// up to 64 KB, and each web server is allowed a total of 640 KB. Sites on a trusted intranet are allowed even more storage.

			// Sharing persistent data
			// can't access persistent data saved by pages in its ancestor directories using IE. no path & domain attributes of cookies.
			// So, persistent data in IE is shared only between pages in the same directory, loaded via the same protocols().
		}
		
		// Flash SharedObject Persistence
		// The Flash plug-in, versions 6 and later, enables client-side persistence with the SharedObject class, which
		// can be scripted with ActionScript code in a Flash movie.[*] To do this, create a SharedObject with
		// ActionScript code like the following.
		// See more details in pdf page 560 - 561

		// Example: Persistent Objects
		// Three persistence mechanisms we've studied above. See more details in pdf page 561 - 568.


		// Persistent Data and Security
		// Don't save any sensitive data on the users' hard disk, they are unencrypted.
		// they may be stolen by malicious software if you do that.
